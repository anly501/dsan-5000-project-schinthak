    "text": "Summary of Long Covid\nCovid-19, the infectious disease originating from the SARS-Cov-2 virus, was declared a global pandemic in March of 2020. As the illness spread, affecting thousands of people worldwide, a multitude of individuals started reporting lasting symptoms after being cleared of the disease. These varying degrees of symptoms after an extended period of time can be classified as long covid. Specifically, “Long COVID is an often debilitating illness that occurs in at least 10% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” Davis et al. (2023). Those who have reported long covid face a variety of symptoms ranging from heart, lung, pancreas, immune, and neurological diseases and chronic illnesses. Additionally, those in existing vulnerability groups such as those with type two diabetes, those of the female sex, and those with autoimmune disease to name a few, are also more susceptible to long covid Davis et al. (2023)."

At the moment, the scientific research in this area is still new and developing, meaning that findings have not made headway for the general audiences. Additionally, there have been very few social science perspectives published regarding the impact of long covid symptoms on the people’s lives or the conversations surrounding this topic in the media. These are topics of conversation which this project hopes to uncover."

    "text": "Past works:\nAs previously mentioned, there is still limited research published surrounding long covid in academic and scientific journals. However, the current published works provide a plethora of information surrounding noted symptoms, sentiments on long covid, and more.\nThe authors of Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations compiled the findings of several COVID-19 research papers as well as collected data from long covid researchers and clinics in order to create a list of long covid symptoms. Additionally, the authors noted a few challenges in their collection process, one of those being the lack of uniformity in testing, especially during the early stages of COVID-19. They also noted that several non-respiratory symptoms go unlabeled as potential long covid symptoms due to the narrative that COVID is only a respiratory illness Davis et al. (2023). With this being said, the work of Davis et al. (2023) on the topic provides a strong base understanding of long covid and the future research that is needed.\nIn conjunction with the previous research, the authors of Attributes and predictors of long COVID continued research on the documented symptoms of long covid across multiple demographics (age, race, location, sex, etc) and created a random forest predictive model in order to make predictions on symptoms on specific demographics. The primary source of their data was from “The COVID Symptom Study is a mobile application” which allows users to self report “daily information on their health status and symptoms, as well as results of any available COVID-19 test” Sudre et al. (2021). Thus, while they were able to provide an extensive analysis of symptoms, this data is only a small subset of the population using the application."

    "text": "Long Covid Symptoms - UK:\nAmongst the data obtained through the UK survey, I will be focusing on survey data regarding symptoms related to prior health as well as employement status. The raw data would be classified as very messy, with most of the column names unreadable and data types unclear. Thus, I did the following for both datasets in order to clean the data.\n\nSince the formatting of the excel sheet is not in a traditional record format, we’ll need to remove some empty columns. Thus, I removed the first four rows, since they were empty.\nNext, we’ll make the top row of the dataframe and make those values the column names.\nUsing the janitor package in R, we’ll also make the column names “tidy”. This means the names will be lower case without any spaces.\nThe columns estimate, lower confidence bound, and upper confidence bound need to be datatype double, so we will cats those columns.\nChecking for NA values; if there are NA values in the estimate column, this means that that group’s data was not collected in the survey. Thus, we’ll drop those rows and report the loss of data (see code).\nLastly, we’ll save the cleaned datasets into csv files.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(janitor)\n\nlong_covid_uk_health &lt;- read_excel(\"../../data/00-raw-data/longcovid_uk.xlsx\", sheet = 'Table 3')\nlong_covid_uk_job &lt;- read_excel(\"../../data/00-raw-data/longcovid_uk.xlsx\", sheet = 'Table 4')\n\n#For Long Covid with regards to Health \n\n#First, we'll remove the first three rows since they're all empty. \nlong_covid_uk_health &lt;- long_covid_uk_health %&gt;%\n  filter(!row_number() %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4))\n\n#Next, we'll make top row the column names:\nlong_covid_uk_health &lt;- long_covid_uk_health %&gt;%\n  purrr::set_names(as.character(slice(., 1))) %&gt;%\n  slice(-1)\n\n#Now, we need to name the column names tidy:\nlong_covid_uk_health &lt;- long_covid_uk_health %&gt;%\n  clean_names()\n\n#Next, we'll need to change the datatypes of certain columns. \nlong_covid_uk_health &lt;- long_covid_uk_health %&gt;%\n  mutate(estimate = as.double(estimate)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(lower_95_percent_confidence_limit = as.double(lower_95_percent_confidence_limit)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(upper_95_percent_confidence_limit = as.double(upper_95_percent_confidence_limit))\n\n#Checking for NA values:\nlong_covid_uk_health %&gt;%\n  summarise_all(~ sum(is.na(.)))\n#No NA values! \n\n#Let's see the cleaned data: \nhead(long_covid_uk_health)\nwrite.csv(long_covid_uk_health, \"../../data/01-modified-data/long_covid_uk_health_clean.csv\")\n\n#For Long Covid with regards to Employement Status:\n\n#Now, we'll do the same cleaning for employement status data since it's the same format:\nlong_covid_uk_job &lt;- long_covid_uk_job %&gt;%\n  filter(!row_number() %in% c(1, 2, 3, 4))\n\n#Next, we'll make top row the column names:\nlong_covid_uk_job &lt;- long_covid_uk_job %&gt;%\n  purrr::set_names(as.character(slice(., 1))) %&gt;%\n  slice(-1)\n\n#Now, we need to name the column names tidy:\nlong_covid_uk_job &lt;- long_covid_uk_job %&gt;%\n  clean_names()\n\n#Next, we'll need to change the datatypes of certain columns. \nlong_covid_uk_job &lt;- long_covid_uk_job %&gt;%\n  mutate(estimate = as.double(estimate)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(lower_95_percent_confidence_limit = as.double(lower_95_percent_confidence_limit)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(upper_95_percent_confidence_limit = as.double(upper_95_percent_confidence_limit))\n\n#Checking for NA values:\nlong_covid_uk_job %&gt;%\n  summarise_all(~ sum(is.na(.)))\n#There are a significant number of NA values for estimate and the confidence intervals. \n#Since these are for specific groups, the NA's mean that data was not collected for these groups. \n#Since we can't use \"other\" groups to estimate this data, we will drop these rows. \n#This results is a loss of 13% of the original dataset. \nlong_covid_uk_job &lt;- long_covid_uk_job %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(estimate))\n\nhead(long_covid_uk_job)\nwrite.csv(long_covid_uk_job, \"../../data/01-modified-data/long_covid_uk_job_clean.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLong Covid UK Survey Data based on Health History - Cleaned\n\n\nUK Survey Health Cleaned Data\n\n\n\nLong Covid UK Survey Data based on Employement Status - Cleaned\n\n\nUK Survey Employement Status Cleaned Data"

SUBJECT:      Addressing the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19   By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:  Section 1.  Policy.  My Administration has made combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and guiding the Nation through the worst public health crisis in more than a century, our top priority.  When I came into office, COVID-19 was wreaking havoc on our country — closing our businesses, keeping our kids out of school, and forcing us into isolation.  Today, America has the tools to protect against COVID-19 and to dramatically decrease its risks.  We move towards a future in which COVID-19 does not disrupt our daily lives and is something we prevent, protect against, and treat.  As we chart the path forward, we remember the more than 950,000 people in the United States lost to COVID-19.  They were beloved parents, grandparents, children, siblings, spouses, neighbors, and friends.  More than 200,000 children in the United States have lost a parent or caregiver to the disease.  Each soul is irreplaceable, and the families and communities left behind are still reeling from profound loss.  Many families and communities have already received support from Federal programs that help with the loss they have experienced.  As we move forward, we commit to ensuring that families and communities can access these support programs and connect to resources they may need to help with their healing, health, and well-being.  At the same time, many of our family members, neighbors, and friends continue to experience negative long-term effects of COVID-19.  Many individuals report debilitating, long-lasting effects of having been infected with COVID-19, often called “long COVID.”  These symptoms can happen to anyone who has had COVID-19 — including individuals across ages, races, genders, and ethnicities; individuals with or without disabilities; individuals with or without underlying health conditions; and individuals whether or not they had initial symptoms.  Individuals experiencing long COVID report experiencing new or recurrent symptoms, which can include anxiety and depression, fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, heart palpitations, disordered sleep, chest and joint pain, headaches, and other symptoms.  These symptoms can persist long after the acute COVID-19 infection has resolved.  Even young people and otherwise healthy people have reported long COVID symptoms that last for many months.  These symptoms may be affecting individuals’ ability to work, conduct daily activities, engage in educational activities, and participate in their communities.  Our world-class research and public health organizations have begun the difficult work of understanding these new conditions, their causes, and potential prevention and treatment options.  Our health care and support programs are working to help meet the needs of individuals experiencing the lasting effects of COVID-19.  To organize the Federal Government’s response, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must work together to use the expertise, resources, and benefit programs of the Federal Government to ensure that we are accelerating scientific progress and providing individuals with the support and services they need.  In addition, the American public is grappling with a mental health crisis exacerbated by the pandemic. Too many have felt the effects of social isolation, sickness, economic insecurity, increased caregiver burdens, and grief.  My Administration has made significant investments in mental health as well as substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery support for the American public, including by expanding access to community-based behavioral health services.  We are committed to advancing these behavioral health efforts in order to better identify the effects of the pandemic on mental health, substance use, and well-being, and to take steps to address these effects for the people we serve.  Our Nation can continue to protect the public — and spare countless families from the deepest pain imaginable — if everybody does their part.  Today, we have numerous tools to protect ourselves and our loved ones from COVID-19 — from vaccines to tests, treatments, masks, and more.  My Administration recognizes the toll of this pandemic on the American public and commits to redoubling our efforts to support the American people in addressing the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives and on society.  Sec. 2.  Organizing the Government-Wide Response to the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19.  (a)  The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) shall coordinate the Government-wide response to the long-term effects of COVID-19.  My Administration will harness the full potential of the Federal Government, in coordination with public- and private-sector partners, to mount a full and effective response.  The Secretary shall report on the coordination efforts to the Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response and Counselor to the President and to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.       (b)  The heads of agencies shall assist and provide information to the Secretary, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the Secretary’s duties described in subsection (a) of this section.       (c)  In performing the duties described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall seek information from relevant nongovernmental experts, organizations, and stakeholders, including individuals affected directly by the long-term effects of COVID-19.  The Secretary shall consider using all available legal authorities, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to assist in gathering relevant information, including a waiver under 42 U.S.C. 247d(f).  Sec. 3.  Report on the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19.  The Secretary, supported within the Department of Health and Human Services by the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, shall publish a public report within 120 days of the date of this memorandum outlining services and mechanisms of support across agencies to assist the American public in the face of the far-reaching and long-term effects of COVID-19.  The report shall outline Federal Government services to support individuals experiencing long COVID, individuals and families experiencing a loss due to COVID-19, and all those grappling with mental health and substance use issues in the wake of this pandemic.  The report shall also specifically address the long-term effects of COVID-19 on underserved communities and efforts to address disparities in availability and adoption of services and support for such communities.  Sec. 4.  National Research Action Plan on Long COVID.  (a)  Coordinated efforts across the public and private sectors are needed to advance progress in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and provision of services for individuals experiencing long COVID.  The Secretary, supported by the Assistant Secretary for Health and in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall coordinate a Government-wide effort to develop the first-ever interagency national research agenda on long COVID, to be reflected in a National Research Action Plan.  The National Research Action Plan will build on ongoing efforts across the Federal Government, including the landmark RECOVER Initiative implemented by the National Institutes of Health.  The Secretary shall release the jointly developed National Research Action Plan within 120 days of the date of this memorandum.
