In this survery, we can see that users were asked to fill out a mutliple of demographic questions and then choose which long covid experience best decribed them.

Firstly, let’s look at the distribution of the value (percent having Long Covid based on the key’s defintion) grouped by each key.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x=\"key\", y=\"value\",\n            hue=\"key\", palette=\"Set2\",\n            data=cdc)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the boxplots, we can see that the distibution across keys is varying, with the highest percentage going to key 6, representing the percentage of adults with any activity limitations from long Covid who also currently have long Covid. The lowest range of values goes to key 9, which represents the percentage of adults of significant activity limitations.\nThus, to understand this data further, we’ll take a look at the additional groups affected by Long Covid in a number of ways.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(15, 25))\n\ngroups = cdc['group'].unique()\nfor i, ax in zip(range(1,9), axs.ravel()):\n    if i == 8:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.barplot(analysis, x=\"subgroup\", y=\"value\", hue = \"subgroup\", ax = ax, errorbar=None)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n        ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n    else:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.barplot(analysis, x=\"subgroup\", y=\"value\", hue = \"subgroup\", estimator = \"mean\", ax = ax, errorbar=None)\n        for j in ax.containers:\n            ax.bar_label(j,)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the data through each group and it’s given sugroups. Primarily, ammongst all Long Covid patients surveyed through the CDC, we can see that the largest age group surveyed was those age 40-49. Additionally, more females responded to the survey than males. In terms of gender and sexuality, cis-gender females and transgender people had a higher experience with long Covid than cis-gender males and bisexual individuals had a greater percentage of long covid experiences. A few other things to note, those in the category “non-hsopanic, other races and multiple races” were highest amongst the ethnicity demographics and not suprisingly, the highest disparity amongst the subcategories was between those who were disabled verses not disabled. Those with a disability had a 12.2% increase in long covid experiences than those who do not have a disability. The is very important to understanding Long Covid, as it has been known to effect those with disabilities more than it say with non-immunocompromised people.\nLastly, we’ll take a look at the overall distributions for each key value in order to understand the survey in greater detail.\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(5, 2, figsize=(15, 25))\n\ngroups = cdc['group'].unique()\nfor i, ax in zip(range(10), axs.ravel()):\n    if i == 9:\n        sns.histplot(cdc, x=\"value\", ax = ax, kde = True)\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title('All')\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n    else:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.histplot(analysis, x=\"value\", ax = ax, kde = True)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\nFor all subgroups and the dataset as a whole, we can see that the distributions are all rightly skewed. This indicates that most of the percentages collected all fell closer to zero. Since this dataset is heavily filled with categorical data, we will try to develop a way to pear down the features through naive bayes analysis and feature selection within the next section."

    "text": "Summary of Long Covid\nCovid-19, the infectious disease originating from the SARS-Cov-2 virus, was declared a global pandemic in March of 2020. As the illness spread, affecting thousands of people worldwide, a multitude of individuals started reporting lasting symptoms after being cleared of the disease. These varying degrees of symptoms after an extended period of time can be classified as long covid. Specifically, “Long COVID is an often debilitating illness that occurs in at least 10% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” Davis et al. (2023). Those who have reported long covid face a variety of symptoms ranging from heart, lung, pancreas, immune, and neurological diseases and chronic illnesses. Additionally, those in existing vulnerability groups such as those with type two diabetes, those of the female sex, and those with autoimmune disease to name a few, are also more susceptible to long covid Davis et al. (2023)."

At the moment, the scientific research in this area is still new and developing, meaning that findings have not made headway for the general audiences. Additionally, there have been very few social science perspectives published regarding the impact of long covid symptoms on the people’s lives or the conversations surrounding this topic in the media. These are topics of conversation which this project hopes to uncover."

    "text": "Past works:\nAs previously mentioned, there is still limited research published surrounding long covid in academic and scientific journals. However, the current published works provide a plethora of information surrounding noted symptoms, sentiments on long covid, and more.\nThe authors of Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations compiled the findings of several COVID-19 research papers as well as collected data from long covid researchers and clinics in order to create a list of long covid symptoms. Additionally, the authors noted a few challenges in their collection process, one of those being the lack of uniformity in testing, especially during the early stages of COVID-19. They also noted that several non-respiratory symptoms go unlabeled as potential long covid symptoms due to the narrative that COVID is only a respiratory illness Davis et al. (2023). With this being said, the work of Davis et al. (2023) on the topic provides a strong base understanding of long covid and the future research that is needed.\nIn conjunction with the previous research, the authors of Attributes and predictors of long COVID continued research on the documented symptoms of long covid across multiple demographics (age, race, location, sex, etc) and created a random forest predictive model in order to make predictions on symptoms on specific demographics. The primary source of their data was from “The COVID Symptom Study is a mobile application” which allows users to self report “daily information on their health status and symptoms, as well as results of any available COVID-19 test” Sudre et al. (2021). Thus, while they were able to provide an extensive analysis of symptoms, this data is only a small subset of the population using the application."

Firstly, let’s look at the distribution of the value (percent having Long Covid based on the key’s defintion) grouped by each key.\n\n# cdc['key'] = cdc['key'].astype('category')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x=\"key\", y=\"value\",\n            hue=\"key\", palette=\"Set2\",\n            data=cdc)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFrom the boxplots, we can see that the distibution across keys is varying, with the highest percentage going to key 6, representing the percentage of adults with any activity limitations from long Covid who also currently have long Covid. The lowest range of values goes to key 9, which represents the percentage of adults of significant activity limitations.\nThus, to understand this data further, we’ll take a look at the additional groups affected by Long Covid in a number of ways.\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(40, 30))\n\ngroups = cdc['group'].unique()\nfor i, ax in zip(range(1,9), axs.ravel()):\n    if i == 8:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.barplot(analysis, x=\"subgroup\", y=\"value\", hue = \"subgroup\", ax = ax, errorbar=None)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n        ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n    else:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.barplot(analysis, x=\"subgroup\", y=\"value\", hue = \"subgroup\", estimator = \"mean\", ax = ax, errorbar=None)\n        for j in ax.containers:\n            ax.bar_label(j,)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nLet’s take a look at the data through each group and it’s given sugroups. Primarily, ammongst all Long Covid patients surveyed through the CDC, we can see that the largest age group surveyed was those age 40-49. Additionally, more females responded to the survey than males. In terms of gender and sexuality, cis-gender females and transgender people had a higher experience with long Covid than cis-gender males and bisexual individuals had a greater percentage of long covid experiences. A few other things to note, those in the category “non-hsopanic, other races and multiple races” were highest amongst the ethnicity demographics and not suprisingly, the highest disparity amongst the subcategories was between those who were disabled verses not disabled. Those with a disability had a 12.2% increase in long covid experiences than those who do not have a disability. The is very important to understanding Long Covid, as it has been known to effect those with disabilities more than it say with non-immunocompromised people.\nLastly, we’ll take a look at the overall distributions for each key value in order to understand the survey in greater detail.\n\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(5, 2, figsize=(40, 30))\n\ngroups = cdc['group'].unique()\nfor i, ax in zip(range(10), axs.ravel()):\n    if i == 9:\n        sns.histplot(cdc, x=\"value\", ax = ax, kde = True)\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title('All')\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n    else:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.histplot(analysis, x=\"value\", ax = ax, kde = True)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\nFor all subgroups and the dataset as a whole, we can see that the distributions are all rightly skewed. This indicates that most of the percentages collected all fell closer to zero. Since this dataset is heavily filled with categorical data, we will try to develop a way to pear down the features through naive bayes analysis and feature selection within the next section.\n\nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\nimport wordcloud \nimport string \nimport nltk\n\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\nstopwords = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')\n\nnews = pd.read_csv('../../data/00-raw-data/long_covid_news_raw.csv')\ntext = news['title'].tolist()\ntext.append(news['content'].tolist())\ntext = ' '.join([str(elem) for elem in text])\n\n# #FILTER OUT UNWANTED CHARACTERS\nnew_text=\"\"\nfor character in text:\n    if character in string.printable:\n        new_text+=character\ntext=new_text\n\n# #FILTER OUT UNWANTED WORDS\nnew_text=\"\"\nfor word in nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(text):\n    if word not in nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'):\n        if word in [\".\",\",\",\"!\",\"?\",\":\",\";\",\"[ removed ]\"]:\n            #remove the last space\n            new_text=new_text[0:-1]+word+\" \"\n        else: #add a space\n            new_text+=word.lower()+\" \"\ntext=new_text\n\nwith open('../../data/01-modified-data/long_covid_news_clean.txt', 'w') as file:\n    # Write the list as a string with elements separated by spaces and add a newline at the end\n    file.write(''.join(map(str, text)) + '\\n')\n\n[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/shchinthak/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package averaged_perceptron_tagger to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/shchinthak/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package averaged_perceptron_tagger is already up-to-\n[nltk_data]       date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/shchinthak/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/shchinthak/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n\n\n\nfile = open(\"../../data/01-modified-data/long_covid_news_clean.txt\", \"r\")\ncontent = file.read()\nprint(content)\ndef generate_word_cloud(my_text):\n    from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    # exit()\n    # Import package\n    # Define a function to plot word cloud\n    def plot_cloud(wordcloud):\n        # Set figure size\n        plt.figure(figsize=(40, 30))\n        # Display image\n        plt.imshow(wordcloud) \n        # No axis details\n        plt.axis(\"off\");\n\n    # Generate word cloud\n    wordcloud = WordCloud(\n        width = 3000,\n        height = 2000, \n        random_state=1, \n        background_color='salmon', \n        colormap='Pastel1', \n        collocations=False,\n        stopwords = STOPWORDS).generate(my_text)\n    plot_cloud(wordcloud)\n    plt.show()\n\ngenerate_word_cloud(content)\n\n[ removed ] [ removed ] `` long colds '' may exist, researchers find studying long covid [ removed ] [ removed ] [ removed ] threads ban sensitive search terms temporary, instagram head says how to cure 'brain fog ' using these super easy expert tips [ removed ] care home boss shocked speed covid variant american long covid sufferers preyed unregulated stem cell clinics a new possible explanation long covid could lead simple treatment patients long covid research is in its most hopeful phase yet have cold cant seem shake? long covid thingand long cold may long-covid may long-term respiratory illness - study it 's long covid: symptoms linger illnesses, leading 'long colds ' long covid: can plant-based, anti-inflammatory diets help? long colds vs. long covid: the differences, similarities symptoms new research offers clues causes long covid fuelling hope eventual treatments [ removed ] brain fog long covid: low serotonin could play role [ removed ] what causes long covid? the answer might gut [ removed ] [ removed ] [ removed ] [ removed ] canadians travelling mexico lyme disease treatments. that worries health experts researchers find long covid might linked brain damage paxlovid may reduce chance long covid. why dont doctors prescribe?
