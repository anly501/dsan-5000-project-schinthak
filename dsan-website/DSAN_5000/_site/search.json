    "text": "Code Implementation and Report\nBelow, you’ll find both code and explanation regarding PCA and t-SNE dimensionality reduction\n\nDimensionality Reduction with PCA\nUsing PCA, one hopes to efficiently distill the multitude of Long Covid symptoms recorded by Harvard University into a concise set of influential dimensions, facilitating the prediction of severe cases requiring hospitalization. PCA removes highly autocorrelated variables while trying to maintain the original data’s variance.\nIn the code below, PCA is applied to the X variables, with the number of components set to 39 initially. The subsequent step involves visualizing the results for different numbers of components. Through this exploration, it is observed that using 25 components appears to strike a balance between preserving data variance and reducing dimensionality. Beyond this point, the explained variance starts to plateau, suggesting diminishing returns in terms of information retained.\nAfter determining that 25 components offer an optimal compromise, a second PCA is executed with the chosen number of components. The resulting graph illustrates the distribution of individuals in the reduced-dimensional space. Unfortunately, despite the successful reduction in dimensionality, the challenge arises when attempting to visually incorporate the hospitalization labels. As PCA operates solely on the input features (X variables), the original labels might not be clearly discernible in the reduced-dimensional scatter plot.\n\nComponent PlotClustering\n\n\n\n\nCode\nX = harvard_covid.loc[:, 'kidney':'anxietydepression']\n\nY = harvard_covid['hospital_admission'].astype('category')\n\n# Standardize the data\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_transform = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n\nn_components_test = len(X.columns)\n\npca = PCA(n_components = n_components_test)\nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_transform)\n\nplt.plot(range(1, len(pca.explained_variance_ratio_) + 1), np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_))\n\n# Add a cross at x = 25\nthreshold_component = 25\nthreshold_variance = np.cumsum(pca.explained_variance_ratio_)[threshold_component - 1]\nplt.scatter(threshold_component, threshold_variance, marker='x', c='red', label=f'Component {threshold_component}')\n\nplt.xlabel('Number of Components')\nplt.ylabel('Cumulative Explained Variance')\nplt.legend()\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nX = harvard_covid.loc[:, 'kidney':'anxietydepression']\n\nY = harvard_covid['hospital_admission'].astype('category')\n\nY , _ = pd.factorize(harvard_covid['hospital_admission'])\nY_label = Y.astype(int)\n\n# Standardize the data\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_transform = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n\nn_components = 25\n\npca = PCA(n_components = n_components)\nX_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_transform)\n\nresults = pd.DataFrame({'X1': X_pca[:, 0], 'X2': X_pca[:, 1], 'Y': Y_label})\nresults\n\nplt.scatter(x = results['X1'], y = results['X2'], c=Y_label)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDimensionality Reduction with t-SNE\nt-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) stands as an alternative dimensionality reduction technique, distinct from PCA. While PCA aims to maintain the variance of the original data, t-SNE prioritizes preserving local similarities within the data. In scenarios where PCA might struggle to provide meaningful reductions for clustering purposes, t-SNE becomes an appealing option.\nAs we saw above, PCA was not able to provide a meaningful reduction for clustering purposes. Thus, we will check whether if this true for the local approach found in t-SNE.\nThe implementation of t-SNE is straightforward, involving the use of standardized X values to fit and transform the t-SNE model. The resulting scatterplot visually displays the distribution of data points in the reduced-dimensional space. However, in the described scenario, the scatterplot illustrates a poor clustering in relation to the hospitalization labels.\nObservations from the scatterplot include the majority of “no” responses (shown in purple) being concentrated at the top of the scatterplot, while the ‘yes’ labels (shown in yellow) are positioned right on top, particularly when the perplexity is set to 30. Perplexity is a hyperparameter in t-SNE that controls the balance between preserving global and local aspects of the data.\nFurther exploration involves testing different perplexity values, such as 10 and 15. However, these variations result in poor clustering approaches, where visually, the dimensions in the data after t-SNE are not distinct enough for sensible classification or machine learning techniques.\n\nPerplexity = 30Perplexity = 10Perplexity = 15\n\n\n\n\nCode\nX = harvard_covid.loc[:, 'kidney':'anxietydepression']\n\nY = harvard_covid['hospital_admission'].astype('category')\n\nY , _ = pd.factorize(harvard_covid['hospital_admission'])\nY_label = Y.astype(int)\n\nscaler = StandardScaler()\nX_transform = scaler.fit_transform(X)\n\nperplexity = 30\n\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, learning_rate='auto', init='random', perplexity=perplexity, random_state=42)\n\ntsne_2019 = tsne.fit_transform(X_transform)\n\nscatter_tsne_2019 = plt.scatter(tsne_2019[:,0],tsne_2019[:,1], c=Y_label, alpha=0.5)\nplt.title(\"TSNE Unsupervised Dimension Clustering (30)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nperplexity = 10\n\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, learning_rate='auto', init='random', perplexity=perplexity, random_state=42)\n\ntsne_2019 = tsne.fit_transform(X_transform)\n\nscatter_tsne_2019 = plt.scatter(tsne_2019[:,0],tsne_2019[:,1], c=Y_label, alpha=0.5)\nplt.title(\"TSNE Unsupervised Dimension Clustering (10)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nperplexity = 15\n\ntsne = TSNE(n_components=2, learning_rate='auto', init='random', perplexity=perplexity, random_state=42)\n\ntsne_2019 = tsne.fit_transform(X_transform)\n\nscatter_tsne_2019 = plt.scatter(tsne_2019[:,0],tsne_2019[:,1], c=Y_label, alpha=0.5)\nplt.title(\"TSNE Unsupervised Dimension Clustering (15)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the two dimensionaltiy reduction techinques, PCA seems to be the better option of the two for classification due to the smaller number of clusters as well as a better identification of the varibale spread."

COVID-\\u206019\\nApril 05, 2022\\nMEMORANDUM FOR THE HEADS OF EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES\\n\\nSUBJECT:      Addressing the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19 \\n\\nBy the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:\\n\\nSection 1.  Policy.  My Administration has made combating the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, and guiding the Nation through the worst public health crisis in more than a century, our top priority.  When I came into office, COVID-19 was wreaking havoc on our country — closing our businesses, keeping our kids out of school, and forcing us into isolation.  Today, America has the tools to protect against COVID-19 and to dramatically decrease its risks.  We move towards a future in which COVID-19 does not disrupt our daily lives and is something we prevent, protect against, and treat.\\n\\nAs we chart the path forward, we remember the more than 950,000 people in the United States lost to COVID-19.  They were beloved parents, grandparents, children, siblings, spouses, neighbors, and friends.  More than 200,000 children in the United States have lost a parent or caregiver to the disease.  Each soul is irreplaceable, and the families and communities left behind are still reeling from profound loss.  Many families and communities have already received support from Federal programs that help with the loss they have experienced.  As we move forward, we commit to ensuring that families and communities can access these support programs and connect to resources they may need to help with their healing, health, and well-being.\\n\\nAt the same time, many of our family members, neighbors, and friends continue to experience negative long-term effects of COVID-19.  Many individuals report debilitating, long-lasting effects of having been infected with COVID-19, often called “long COVID.”  These symptoms can happen to anyone who has had COVID-19 — including individuals across ages, races, genders, and ethnicities; individuals with or without disabilities; individuals with or without underlying health conditions; and individuals whether or not they had initial symptoms.  Individuals experiencing long COVID report experiencing new or recurrent symptoms, which can include anxiety and depression, fatigue, shortness of breath, difficulty concentrating, heart palpitations, disordered sleep, chest and joint pain, headaches, and other symptoms.  These symptoms can persist long after the acute COVID-19 infection has resolved.  Even young people and otherwise healthy people have reported long COVID symptoms that last for many months.  These symptoms may be affecting individuals’ ability to work, conduct daily activities, engage in educational activities, and participate in their communities.  Our world-class research and public health organizations have begun the difficult work of understanding these new conditions, their causes, and potential prevention and treatment options.  Our health care and support programs are working to help meet the needs of individuals experiencing the lasting effects of COVID-19.  To organize the Federal Government’s response, executive departments and agencies (agencies) must work together to use the expertise, resources, and benefit programs of the Federal Government to ensure that we are accelerating scientific progress and providing individuals with the support and services they need.\\n\\nIn addition, the American public is grappling with a mental health crisis exacerbated by the pandemic. Too many have felt the effects of social isolation, sickness, economic insecurity, increased caregiver burdens, and grief.  My Administration has made significant investments in mental health as well as substance use disorder prevention, treatment, and recovery support for the American public, including by expanding access to community-based behavioral health services.  We are committed to advancing these behavioral health efforts in order to better identify the effects of the pandemic on mental health, substance use, and well-being, and to take steps to address these effects for the people we serve.\\n\\nOur Nation can continue to protect the public — and spare countless families from the deepest pain imaginable — if everybody does their part.  Today, we have numerous tools to protect ourselves and our loved ones from COVID-19 — from vaccines to tests, treatments, masks, and more.  My Administration recognizes the toll of this pandemic on the American public and commits to redoubling our efforts to support the American people in addressing the long-term effects of COVID-19 on their lives and on society.\\n\\nSec. 2.  Organizing the Government-Wide Response to the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19.  (a)  The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) shall coordinate the Government-wide response to the long-term effects of COVID-19.  My Administration will harness the full potential of the Federal Government, in coordination with public- and private-sector partners, to mount a full and effective response.  The Secretary shall report on the coordination efforts to the Coordinator of the COVID-19 Response and Counselor to the President and to the Assistant to the President for Domestic Policy.\\n\\n     (b)  The heads of agencies shall assist and provide information to the Secretary, consistent with applicable law, as may be necessary to carry out the Secretary’s duties described in subsection (a) of this section.\\n\\n     (c)  In performing the duties described in subsection (a) of this section, the Secretary shall seek information from relevant nongovernmental experts, organizations, and stakeholders, including individuals affected directly by the long-term effects of COVID-19.  The Secretary shall consider using all available legal authorities, as appropriate and consistent with applicable law, to assist in gathering relevant information, including a waiver under 42 U.S.C. 247d(f).\\n\\nSec. 3.  Report on the Long-Term Effects of COVID-19.  The Secretary, supported within the Department of Health and Human Services by the Assistant Secretary for Health and the Assistant Secretary for Mental Health and Substance Use, shall publish a public report within 120 days of the date of this memorandum outlining services and mechanisms of support across agencies to assist the American public in the face of the far-reaching and long-term effects of COVID-19.  The report shall outline Federal Government services to support individuals experiencing long COVID, individuals and families experiencing a loss due to COVID-19, and all those grappling with mental health and substance use issues in the wake of this pandemic.  The report shall also specifically address the long-term effects of COVID-19 on underserved communities and efforts to address disparities in availability and adoption of services and support for such communities.\\n\\nSec. 4.  National Research Action Plan on Long COVID.  (a)  Coordinated efforts across the public and private sectors are needed to advance progress in prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and provision of services for individuals experiencing long COVID.  The Secretary, supported by the Assistant Secretary for Health and in collaboration with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Energy, and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs, shall coordinate a Government-wide effort to develop the first-ever interagency national research agenda on long COVID, to be reflected in a National Research Action Plan.  The National Research Action Plan will build on ongoing efforts across the Federal Government, including the landmark RECOVER Initiative implemented by the National Institutes of Health.  The Secretary shall release the jointly developed National Research Action Plan within 120 days of the date of this memorandum.\\n\\n     (b)  The National Research Action Plan shall build upon existing research efforts and include strategies to:\\n\\n          (i)     help measure and characterize long COVID in both children and adults, including with respect to its frequency, severity, duration, risk factors, and trends over time;\\n\\n          (ii)    support the development of estimates on prevalence and incidence of long COVID disaggregated by demographic groups and symptoms;\\n\\n          (iii)   better understand the epidemiology, course of illness, risk factors, and vaccine effectiveness in prevention of long COVID;\\n\\n          (iv)    advance our understanding of the health and socioeconomic burdens on individuals affected by long COVID, including among different race and ethnicity groups, pregnant people, and those with underlying disabilities;\\n\\n          (v)     foster development of new treatments and care models for long COVID based on a better understanding of the pathophysiological mechanisms of the SARS-CoV-2 virus;\\n\\n          (vi)    inform decisions related to high-quality support, services, and interventions for long COVID;\\n\\n          (vii)   improve data-sharing between agencies and academic and industry researchers about long COVID, to the extent permitted by law; and\\n\\n          (viii)  specifically account for the pandemic’s effect on underserved communities and rural populations.\\n\\nSec. 5.  General Provisions.  (a)  Nothing in this memorandum shall be construed to impair or otherwise affect:\\n\\n          (i)   the authority granted by law to an executive department or agency, or the head thereof; or\\n\\n          (ii)  the functions of the Director of the Office of Management and Budget relating to budgetary, administrative, or legislative proposals.\\n\\n     (b)  This memorandum shall be implemented consistent with applicable law and subject to the availability of appropriations.\\n\\n     (c)  This memorandum is not intended to, and does not, create any right or benefit, substantive or procedural, enforceable at law or in equity by any party against the United States, its departments, agencies, or entities, its officers, employees, or agents, or any other person.\\n\\n     (d)  The Secretary is authorized and directed to publish this memorandum in the Federal Register.\\n\\nJOSEPH R.

    "text": "Summary of Long Covid\nCOVID-19, the infectious disease originating from the SARS-Cov-2 virus, was declared a global pandemic in March of 2020. As the illness spread, affecting thousands of people worldwide, a multitude of individuals started reporting lasting symptoms after being cleared of the disease. These varying degrees of symptoms after an extended period of time can be classified as long covid. Specifically, “Long COVID is an often debilitating illness that occurs in at least 10% of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2” Davis et al. (2023). Those who have reported long covid face a variety of symptoms ranging from heart, lung, pancreas, immune, and neurological diseases, as well as chronic illnesses. Additionally, those in existing vulnerability groups such as those with type two diabetes, those of the female sex, and those with an autoimmune disease to name a few, are also more susceptible to long covid Davis et al. (2023)."

At the moment, the scientific research in this area is still new and developing, meaning that findings have not made headway for the general audiences. Additionally, there have been very few social science perspectives published regarding the impact of long covid symptoms on the people’s lives, the coverage of this illness in the public health and government sectors, or the conversations surrounding this topic in the media. These are topics of conversation which this project hopes to uncover."

    "text": "Past works:\nAs previously mentioned, there is still limited research published surrounding long covid in academic and scientific journals. However, the current published works provide a plethora of information surrounding noted symptoms, sentiments on long covid, and more.\nThe authors of Long COVID: major findings, mechanisms and recommendations compiled the findings of several COVID-19 research papers as well as collected data from long covid researchers and clinics in order to create a list of long covid symptoms. Additionally, the authors noted a few challenges in their collection process, one of those being the lack of uniformity in testing, especially during the early stages of COVID-19. They also noted that several non-respiratory symptoms go unlabeled as potential long covid symptoms due to the narrative that COVID is only a respiratory illness Davis et al. (2023). With that being said, the work of Davis et al. (2023) on the topic provides a strong base understanding of long covid and the future research that is needed.\nIn conjunction with the previous research, the authors of Attributes and predictors of long COVID continued research on the documented symptoms of long covid across multiple demographics (age, race, location, sex, etc.) and created a random forest predictive model in order to make predictions on symptoms on specific demographics. The primary source of their data was from “The COVID Symptom Study is a mobile application” which allows users to self-report “daily information on their health status and symptoms, as well as results of any available COVID-19 test” Sudre et al. (2021). Thus, while they were able to provide an extensive analysis of symptoms, this data is only a small subset of the population using the application."

This stems from the accessible public information tailored to these populations, a lack of education targeted at addressing their specific needs, and a notable absence of government assistance for individuals struggling with chronic health issues resulting from the enduring effects of COVID-19. The amalgamation of these factors appears to contribute to a scenario where these already disadvantaged groups encounter more pronounced challenges in coping with the aftermath of the pandemic."

    "text": "Conclusion\nWhile our testing confusion matrix has a larger number of false positives, we can still make a few conclusions for the decision tree. Firstly, we can say the hospitalization due to long covid, from these survey results, seems to affect women as opposed to men. Additionally, those who experienced tingling seemed to be men over females. Additionally, as previously noted in EDA, those who experienced hair loss were entirely female. Hair loss is common in women due to stress and hormonal changes. This could mean that long covid may be affecting women hormonally or causing abnormal levels of stress, however more data and research would need to be collected to investigate that emerging thought.\nThus, decision trees can provide an easy way to classify a number of binary classes. If data was to be publicly released regarding individuals who experienced either Long Covid or Covid and their symptoms, we would be able to create a classifier that determines what symptoms are more highly for those with Long Covid."

    "text": "Theory\nThe clustering methods we will take a look at is K-means, DBSCAN, and Hierarchy. First, let’s provide an explanation of each clustering method.\nK-Means clustering is a method used to group individuals into ‘k’ number of clusters, where each cluster is represented by a centroid. In the context of Long Covid, this means identifying distinct subgroups of patients with similar symptom profiles. The algorithm assigns data points to the nearest centroid, initialized at random, and updates the centroid based on the mean of the assigned points. The ‘k’ value is chosen based on an understanding of potential subgroups within the data. With Long Covid, this could represent different severity levels or symptom clusters.\nNext, let’s discuss DBSCAN. This algorithm, popularized through the sklearn package, identifies clusters based on regions of high data point density. In the context of Long Covid, this method can reveal clusters of patients with similar symptom patterns, even if the clusters have unique shapes, sizes, and radius. Data points not belonging to any cluster are considered outliers or noise, which DBSCAN will remove from the model. For Long Covid, DBSCAN might uncover less prevalent symptom patterns that could be crucial in understanding specific subsets of patients.\nLastly, we’ll take a look at the Hierarchical algorithm. This method merges or divides clusters, initially randomized, until all individual data points are in their own clusters. This method is advantageous for understanding hierarchical relationships within the data. This may be considered a “top-down” approach in comparison to the other two models.\nFor model selection, ensuring the optimal ‘k’, a correct radius size, or a “linkage” method requires maximizing silhouette scores, which measures the cohesion and separation between clusters. Essentially, a higher silhouette score indicates better-defined clusters.\nThus, using these methods and the maximizing of silhouette scores to hyper tune the models, we’ll determine which is the best to use for the context of our data science problems."

    "text": "Methods\nPrimarily, we’ll define the maximize_silhouette function which calculates the optimal parameter number for each type of model. Once the silhouette score is calculated at every parameter number until the maximum, a line plot is graphed to show the optimal parameter. As mentioned previously, the optimal parameter is the one that results in the highest silhouette score.\nTo further explain this function, maximize_silhouette is designed to find the optimal number of clusters for a clustering algorithm (specified by the algo parameter) by maximizing the silhouette score. The silhouette score is a measure of how well-defined the clusters are in a clustering result, with higher scores indicating more distinct and well-separated clusters.\nThe function takes as input a data matrix X, the choice of clustering algorithm, the maximum number of clusters to consider, and an option to visualize the silhouette scores. The algorithm choices include “birch,” “ag” (Agglomerative Clustering), “dbscan” (DBSCAN), and “kmeans” (K-Means).\nThe function iterates over different numbers of clusters, fits the specified clustering model to the data, calculates the silhouette score, and stores the results. The optimal number of clusters is determined by the maximum silhouette score. If visualization is enabled (i_plot=True), the function generates a plot showing the silhouette scores for different numbers of clusters.\nThe optimal cluster labels corresponding to the optimal parameter are returned by the function. This code is useful for automating the process of finding the optimal number of clusters based on silhouette scores, aiding in the selection of an appropriate clustering configuration for the given data.\n\n\nCode\ndef maximize_silhouette(X,algo=\"birch\",nmax=20,i_plot=False):\n\n    # PARAM\n    i_print=False\n\n    #FORCE CONTIGUOUS\n    X=np.ascontiguousarray(X)\n\n    # LOOP OVER HYPER-PARAM\n    params=[]; \n    sil_scores=[]\n    sil_max=-10\n\n    for param in range(2,nmax+1):\n        if(algo==\"ag\"):\n            model = sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=param).fit(X)\n            labels=model.labels_\n\n        if(algo==\"dbscan\"):\n            param=0.25*(param-1)\n            model = sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN(eps=param).fit(X)\n            labels=model.labels_\n\n        if(algo==\"kmeans\"):\n            model = sklearn.cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=param).fit(X)\n            labels=model.predict(X)\n\n        try:\n            sil_scores.append(silhouette_score(X,labels))\n            params.append(param)\n        except:\n            continue\n\n        if(i_print): print(param,sil_scores[-1])\n\n        if(sil_scores[-1]&gt;sil_max):\n             opt_param=param\n             sil_max=sil_scores[-1]\n             opt_labels=labels\n\n    print(\"OPTIMAL PARAMETER =\",opt_param)\n\n    if(i_plot):\n        fig, ax = plt.subplots()\n        ax.plot(params, sil_scores, \"-o\")\n        ax.set(xlabel='Hyper-parameter', ylabel='Silhouette')\n        plt.show()\n\n    return opt_labels\n\n\n\nK-means\n\nOptimal ParametersClustering\n\n\n\n\nCode\nopt_labels_kmeans = maximize_silhouette(X_pca, algo=\"kmeans\", nmax=12, i_plot=True)\n\n\nOPTIMAL PARAMETER = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclusters_kmeans = 2\nmodel_kmeans = sklearn.cluster.KMeans(n_clusters=clusters_kmeans).fit(X_pca)\nlabels_kmeans = model_kmeans.predict(X_pca)\n\nplot(X_pca,labels_kmeans)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUtilizing the maximize_silhouette function, the analysis reveals that the optimal parameter k for clustering is determined to be 2. This implies that, based on the silhouette score maximization, the most appropriate number of clusters for the given data is 2.\nThe scatterplot visualization illustrates the distinct clustering pattern generated by k-means. In this case, the algorithm successfully identified and separated the data into two clusters, mirroring the correct number of clusters required to categorize the hospitalization variable effectively. This visual confirmation not only validates the effectiveness of the silhouette-based optimization but also provides a tangible representation of the clustering outcome.\n\n\nDBSCAN\n\nOptimal ParametersClustering\n\n\n\n\nCode\nopt_labels_dbscan = maximize_silhouette(X_pca, algo=\"dbscan\", nmax=12, i_plot=True)\n\n\nOPTIMAL PARAMETER = 2.75\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclusters_kmeans = 2.75\nmodel_DBSCAN = sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN(eps=clusters_kmeans).fit(X_pca)\nlabels_dbscan = model_DBSCAN.labels_\n\nplot(X_pca,labels_dbscan)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter running the maximizing the silhouette number, the optimal eps number for DBSCAN is 2.75. Using this number of the sklearn model, we can see that the clustering chosen was 2 distinct clusters. The clustering itself, however, is very off in comparison to the actual labels or K-means clustering. Very few datapoints are labeled in the color yellow, or “yes”, meaning that this clustering is heavily skewed. Therefore, it appears that due to DBSCAN’s use of the outlier detection and algorithm was ineffective in clustering in our data.\n\n\nHierarchical\n\nOptimal ParametersClustering\n\n\n\n\nCode\nopt_labels_ag = maximize_silhouette(X_pca, algo=\"ag\", nmax=12, i_plot=True)\n\n\nOPTIMAL PARAMETER = 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nclusters_ag = 2\nmodel_AG = sklearn.cluster.AgglomerativeClustering(n_clusters=clusters_ag).fit(X_pca)\nlabels_ag = model_AG.labels_\n\nplot(X_pca,labels_ag)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the maximum silhouette function, we can see that the optimal parameter is 2. Using this parameter in the hierarchy model, we get a clustering very similar to k-means, with the slight difference being more clustering to the “no” label on the top of the plot. The clusters are clear and the number of clusters is also accurate to the hospitalization data."

Primarily, the models produced, k-means and hierarchy created clusters that were accurate to the supervised labeled data for hospitalization. The best of the three models was hierarchy, and this could be due to the fact that the hierarchical model uses a top-down approach with clustering in to the dwindle down to the strongest relationships in the data. This makes the most sense for the data at hand since the Harvard survey data had such a large number of symptoms.\nHowever, the most likely conclusion that can be made, rather than focusing on the models, is the data at hand. In both PCA and t-SNE, the scatterplot of the transformed X values, ignoring the Y labels, was visually separated into two clusters. However, these clusters in the data did not perfectly align with the labels for the hospitalization metric. Therefore, to better understand the survey data, it may be best to try to implement clustering with other target variables in order to find the one that’s best represented by the symptom data at hand."

Firstly, let’s look at the distribution of the value (percent having Long Covid based on the key’s defintion) grouped by each key.\n\n\nCode\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x=\"key\", y=\"value\",\n            hue=\"key\", palette=\"Set2\",\n            data=cdc)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(10, 25))\n\ngroups = cdc['group'].unique()\nfor i, ax in zip(range(1,9), axs.ravel()):\n    if i == 8:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.barplot(analysis, x=\"subgroup\", y=\"value\", hue = \"subgroup\", ax = ax, errorbar=None)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n        ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=90)\n    else:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.barplot(analysis, x=\"subgroup\", y=\"value\", hue = \"subgroup\", estimator = \"mean\", ax = ax, errorbar=None)\n        for j in ax.containers:\n            ax.bar_label(j,)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n        ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(5, 2, figsize=(10, 25))\n\ngroups = cdc['group'].unique()\nfor i, ax in zip(range(10), axs.ravel()):\n    if i == 9:\n        sns.histplot(cdc, x=\"value\", ax = ax, kde = True)\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title('All')\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n    else:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.histplot(analysis, x=\"value\", ax = ax, kde = True)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n\nplt.tight_layout()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the boxplots, we can see that the distribution across keys is varying, with the highest percentage going to key 6, representing the percentage of adults with any activity limitations from long Covid who also currently have long Covid. The lowest range of values goes to key 9, which represents the percentage of adults of significant activity limitations.\nThus, to understand this data further, we’ll take a look at the additional groups affected by Long Covid in a number of ways.\nLet’s take a look at the data through each group and it’s given subgroups. Primarily, amongst all Long Covid patients surveyed through the CDC, we can see that the largest age group surveyed was those age 40-49. Additionally, more females responded to the survey than males. In terms of gender and sexuality, cis-gender females and transgender people had a higher experience with long Covid than cis-gender males and bisexual individuals had a greater percentage of long covid experiences. A few other things to note, those in the category “non-Hispanic, other races and multiple races” were highest amongst the ethnicity demographics and not surprisingly, the highest disparity amongst the subcategories was between those who were disabled verses not disabled. Those with a disability had a 12.2% increase in long covid experiences than those who do not have a disability. The is very important to understanding Long Covid, as it has been known to effect those with disabilities more than it say with non-immunocompromised people.\nLastly, we’ll take a look at the overall distributions for each key value in order to understand the survey in greater detail.\nFor all subgroups and the dataset as a whole, we can see that the distributions are all rightly skewed. This indicates that most of the percentages collected all fell closer to zero. Since this dataset is heavily filled with categorical data, we will try to develop a way to pare down the features through naive bayes analysis and feature selection within the next section."

If we to extrapolate from the survey data, we could also use the lower and upper confidence boundaries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nIn order to understand the dataset and the symptoms, let’s take a look at the symptoms for all people that filled out the survey. The interactive bubble plot above shows the CRIS survey data for multiple demographics and sub demographics. Using the filtering option, you can choose which demographic’s symptoms you’d like to view and the percent of each symptom out of the entire CRIS participant population. Thus, we can notice a few things. Across all demographics, cough, weakness/tiredness, shortness of breath, and joint pain were the highest recorded symptoms. Additionally, in terms of ethnic groups, non-white populations seem to have higher worry or anxiety and trouble sleeping in comparison to their white counterparts. This could be due to a number of socioeconomic factors, however, it’s still a very telling discover. Lastly, another thing to note is that much of the popular symptoms tracked across all demographics are mental (difficulty, worry or anxiety, and feelings of weakness). This is interesting to note since many, from an anecdotal perspective, experience these symptoms after COVID and do not identify as having Long Covid. Thus, it would be interesting to examine if mental side effects are a direct sign Long Covid post COVID diagnosis."

To answer one of our data science questions, we can look to the sex variable to see the differences in symptoms between the categories. Below is a visualization of the symptoms categorized by sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\nFrom this stacked bar plot, we can see a number of interesting things about the symptoms. For starters, symptoms of trouble chewing/swallowing and heart attacks are exclusive to the men survey in this study. Additionally, women exclusively experience hair loss as a result of Long Covid. As we previously saw stress, worry, and anxiety being popular symptoms of Long Covid, we can deduce that hair loss may be an exogenous to overall stress of Long Covid. Additionally, on average, it appears that women are more likely to have headaches, muscle pain, weakness in the arms, and ageusia (the loss of taste). For men, on average, they are more likely to experience anxiety or depression, general covid complications, and hospitalization due to the severity of their symptoms. From these insights, we can say that men may be more likely to experience mental health problems as a result of long covid. However, given that these survey results are self-reported, we will need to look at the other datasets to make a more inferred conclusion."

From there we grouped the data by each infectious disease (Long Covid, chickenpox, and influenza) and plotted the sentiment score over time. The results of this analysis show that the strength in which Long Covid is talked about in media, both positive and negative, is less than influenza and chickenpox, with the absolute strength on both sides being approximately 0.8. In comparison, chickenpox had both positive and negative articles with strength close to 1. Additionally, chickenpox had articles clustered to zero in the beginning, indicating neutral reporting. However, as time progressed, we see drastic shifts in sentiment. Influenza and Long Covid, however, see a continuous fluctuation in sentiment, with influenza have higher strength in sentiment, especially with negative works. Thus, from this sentiment analysis, we can say that Long Covid seems to be the most neutral in comparison to the two other infectious diseases chosen."

caregiver to the disease each soul is irreplaceable and the families and communities left behind are still reeling from profound loss many families and communities have already received support from federal programs that help with the loss they have experienced as we move forward we commit to ensuring that families and communities can access these support programs and connect to resources they may need to help with their healing health and wellbeing\n6 at the same time many of our family members neighbors and friends continue to experience negative longterm effects of covid19 many individuals report debilitating longlasting effects of having been infected with covid19 often called long covid these symptoms can happen to anyone who has had covid19 including individuals across

shown in the graph above. From this graph, we can see that the document takes on a positive sentiment for the majority of the writing. There is an exception in the seventh paragraph, with the sentiment being approximately -0.5. Looking back at the paragraph, we can see that the president discusses the growing pains of the nation due to the COVID-19 pandemic in regards to the mental health crisis, lack of childcare and education, as well as the grief of the country over the millions lost to the disease. However, the tone of the memorandum changes as President Biden addresses the nations courage and resilience, as well as the steps being taken to combat Long Covid. Overall, we can say that the White House presented the country with a positive message on Long Covid in the midst of a divided nation."

The following indicator demographics were collected: The percentage of all U.S. adults who EVER experienced post-COVID conditions (long COVID) that lasted three months or longer and had COVID, the percentage of adults who EVER experienced post-COVID conditions (long COVID) among those who ever had COVID, the percentage of all U.S. adults who are CURRENTLY experiencing post-COVID conditions (long COVID) symptoms and had COVID, and the percentage of adults who are CURRENTLY experiencing post-COVID conditions (long COVID) among those who ever had COVID. The next columns we can discuss are group and subgroup, where group describes the demographic category (age, sex, gender, race) and the subgroup is the values within the group (age ranges and specific sex, gender, and race). Other columns include State (the entirety of the U.S is also included), Time (number of weeks), the Value, which is the percentage of the indicator group.\nPlease Note: In the survey questions, the CDC pre-defined Long Covid sympotoms as the following: “Long term symptoms may include: Tiredness or fatigue, difficulty thinking, concentrating, forgetfulness, or memory problems (sometimes referred to as “brain fog”), difficulty breathing or shortness of breath, joint or muscle pain, fast-beating or pounding heart (also known as heart palpitations), chest pain, dizziness on standing, menstrual changes, changes to taste/smell, or inability to exercise.”\n\n\n\nCDC Survey Data\n\n\nCDC Raw Data"

In order to clean the data, I did the following. You can find the documented code for this cleaning process below.\n\nFirst, I dropped the columns related to quartiles (quartile_range, quartile_number, and suppression_flag) as they are irrelevant to our future analysis.\nSince the values in the column indicator are quite long, I decided to create a numerical key system where each number corresponds to a unique values of the indicator. This is helpful for future categorization techinques as well as with readability.\nNext, I dropped interval columns (time_period_label and confidence_interval) since the time interval information is already represented in the columns time_period_start_date and time_period_end_date and the confidence interval is not needed for future analysis.\nIn order to utilize time, I needed to convert the current start and end time columns into datatime data types.\nWe can see that within the group column, serveral of the data points begin within the phrase “By”. Thus, we will remove it from all values in that column. This will improve any efforts on clustering/decision trees as well as make the data more readable.\nLastly, I decided to remove all rows where the value column was NA, thus eliminating all NA values in the dataset. 12.5% of the original dataset was filtered out. I made this decision since the column value is our main focus of analysis and replacing any NAs with zeros would be compromising the integrity of the data and the representation of certain demographics.\n\n\n\nCDC Data Cleaning\n#Let's drop the last three columns related to quartiles since it is unnessesary. \ncdc &lt;- cdc %&gt;%\n  select(-quartile_range, -quartile_number, -suppression_flag)\n\n#Now, let's check the unique values of indicator to condense the values since they're a little too long\ncdc_keys &lt;- cdc %&gt;%\n  select(indicator) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\ncdc_keys &lt;- cdc_keys %&gt;%\n  mutate(key = 1:nrow(cdc_keys))\n\n#Since there are 10 unique categories, we'll create a new column with a key, such that the number matches up with a value. \ncdc &lt;- cdc %&gt;%\n  right_join(cdc_keys, by = \"indicator\")\n\n#We can also eliminate time_period_label and confidence_interval as both values are repeated in other columns \ncdc &lt;- cdc %&gt;%\n  select(-time_period_label, -confidence_interval)\n\n#Now, let's make the time start and time end datetime variables\ncdc &lt;- cdc %&gt;%\n  mutate(time_period_start_date = as.Date(time_period_start_date)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(time_period_end_date = as.Date(time_period_end_date))\n\n#Let's look at the unique values for the group column and adjust as needed:\n\ncdc &lt;- cdc %&gt;%\n  mutate(group = str_replace(group, \"^By\\\\s\", \"\"))\n\n#We also need to check for any na values \n\n#cdc %&gt;% summarise_all(~ sum(is.na(.)))\n\n#From this we can say that the columns that have na's are all value and the corresponding lowci and highci.

After that was complete I saved the cleaned data into a csv.\n\n\n\nHarvard Survey Cleaning\nharvard_covid &lt;- read_csv(\"../../data/00-raw-data/harvard_long_covid.csv\")\n\nharvard_covid &lt;- harvard_covid %&gt;%\n  select(status:Hospital_admission, age:Headache_covid) %&gt;%\n  select(-country, -income, -ethnicity, -PE2, -BMICat, -Vaccination_status, \n         -No_Doses, -Type_vaccine, -agegroup, -agegroup2, -DVT3, -DVT2, \n         -Median_followupTime, -Median_followupTime2, -kidney3, -Heart_attack3) %&gt;%\n  filter(!is.na(sex) & !is.na(CovidPositive) & !is.na(BMI) & \n           !is.na(Hospital_admission) & !is.na(days_acuteCovid)) %&gt;%\n  clean_names() %&gt;%\n  rename_all(~sub(\"2$\", \"\", .)) %&gt;%\n  rename_all(~sub(\"3$\", \"\", .)) %&gt;%\n  rename_all(~sub(\"_now$\", \"\", .)) %&gt;%\n  rename_all(~sub(\"_pastweek$\", \"\", .)) %&gt;%\n  replace(is.na(.), 0)\n\nwrite.csv(harvard_covid, \"../../data/01-modified-data/harvard_long_covid_clean.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nHarvard Survey Data - Cleaned\n\n\nHarvard Survey Cleaned Data"

    "text": "Long Covid News\nAnother pillar of my analysis is to measure the media coverage on long covid and its sentiment. I used the NewsAPI to collect current news information surrounding long covid, as well as coverage on chickenpox and influenza. Since the data came from an API, there isn’t too much cleaning needed to be done on the columns, however, the text needs to be cleaned.\nIn the code below, I created a clean text function that removes any non alphabetic-numeric charcaters, removed any leading or trailing white spaces, removed any singular letters, nonsensical words, and ellipses. After removed those characters, I merged all text in the dataframe into one string in order to visualize the cleaned text in the word cloud below. This word cloud contains media coverage for long covid, influeza, and chickenpox.\n\n\nNews Cleaning\nnews = pd.read_csv('../../data/00-raw-data/news_raw.csv')\nnews = news[news['content'] != '[Removed]']\n\nnews['all_text'] = news['title'] + ' ' + news['description'] + ' ' + news['content']\n\ndef clean_text(text):\n  # Add your text cleaning logic here\n  cleaned_text = text.lower()  # Example: Convert to lowercase\n  cleaned_text = cleaned_text.strip()  # Remove leading and trailing spaces\n  cleaned_text = re.sub(r'\\[.*?\\]', '', cleaned_text) \n  cleaned_text = ' '.join(cleaned_text.split()[:-1])\n  cleaned_text = re.sub(r'[^a-zA-Z0-9 ]', '', cleaned_text)  # Remove special characters\n  cleaned_text = re.sub(r'\\.\\.\\.+', '', cleaned_text)\n  cleaned_text = cleaned_text.replace('...', '')  # Remove ellipses\n  cleaned_text = cleaned_text.replace('doziernurphotoshutterstock', '')  # Remove specifc word\n  cleaned_text = cleaned_text.replace('/', ' ')  # Remove '/'\n  cleaned_text = ' '.join([word for word in cleaned_text.split() if len(word) &gt; 1 or word.lower() in {'i', 'a'}])\n\n  \n  return cleaned_text\n\nnews['all_text'] = news['all_text'].apply(clean_text)\n\nnews.to_csv('../../data/01-modified-data/news_clean.csv', index = False)\n\n\ntext = news['all_text'].tolist()\ntext = ' '.join([str(elem) for elem in text])\n\n# #FILTER OUT UNWANTED CHARACTERS\nnew_text=\"\"\nfor character in text:\n    if character in string.printable:\n        new_text+=character\ntext=new_text\n\n# #FILTER OUT UNWANTED WORDS\nnew_text=\"\"\nfor word in nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(text):\n    if word not in nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'):\n        if word in [\".\",\",\",\"!\",\"?\",\":\",\";\"]:\n            #remove the last space\n            new_text=new_text[0:-1]+word+\" \"\n        else: #add a space\n            new_text+=word.lower()+\" \"\ntext=new_text\n\ndef generate_word_cloud(my_text):\n    from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    # exit()\n    # Import package\n    # Define a function to plot word cloud\n    def plot_cloud(wordcloud):\n        # Set figure size\n        plt.figure(figsize=(40, 30))\n        # Display image\n        plt.imshow(wordcloud) \n        # No axis details\n        plt.axis(\"off\");\n\n    # Generate word cloud\n    wordcloud = WordCloud(\n        width = 3000,\n        height = 2000, \n        random_state=1, \n        background_color='salmon', \n        colormap='Pastel1', \n        collocations=False,\n        stopwords = STOPWORDS).generate(my_text)\n    plot_cloud(wordcloud)\n    plt.show()\n\ngenerate_word_cloud(text)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this word cloud, we can see stand out topics like Long Covid, of course, as well as respiratory, China, virus, vaccine, and hospital. These words suggest that the media coverage on all three illnesses is medical in nature as well as explanatory of the origins of Covid. For further analysis, we’ll look to the EDA section for sentiment analysis.\nNews Cleaned Data"

Firstly, let’s look at the distribution of the value (percent having Long Covid based on the key’s defintion) grouped by each key.\n# cdc['key'] = cdc['key'].astype('category')\nfig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.boxplot(x=\"key\", y=\"value\",\n            hue=\"key\", palette=\"Set2\",\n            data=cdc)\nplt.show()\nFrom the boxplots, we can see that the distibution across keys is varying, with the highest percentage going to key 6, representing the percentage of adults with any activity limitations from long Covid who also currently have long Covid. The lowest range of values goes to key 9, which represents the percentage of adults of significant activity limitations.\nThus, to understand this data further, we’ll take a look at the additional groups affected by Long Covid in a number of ways.\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(4, 2, figsize=(40, 30))\n\ngroups = cdc['group'].unique()\nfor i, ax in zip(range(1,9), axs.ravel()):\n    if i == 8:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.barplot(analysis, x=\"subgroup\", y=\"value\", hue = \"subgroup\", ax = ax, errorbar=None)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n        ax.tick_params(axis='x', rotation=45)\n    else:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.barplot(analysis, x=\"subgroup\", y=\"value\", hue = \"subgroup\", estimator = \"mean\", ax = ax, errorbar=None)\n        for j in ax.containers:\n            ax.bar_label(j,)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n\nplt.show()\nLet’s take a look at the data through each group and it’s given sugroups. Primarily, ammongst all Long Covid patients surveyed through the CDC, we can see that the largest age group surveyed was those age 40-49. Additionally, more females responded to the survey than males. In terms of gender and sexuality, cis-gender females and transgender people had a higher experience with long Covid than cis-gender males and bisexual individuals had a greater percentage of long covid experiences. A few other things to note, those in the category “non-hsopanic, other races and multiple races” were highest amongst the ethnicity demographics and not suprisingly, the highest disparity amongst the subcategories was between those who were disabled verses not disabled. Those with a disability had a 12.2% increase in long covid experiences than those who do not have a disability. The is very important to understanding Long Covid, as it has been known to effect those with disabilities more than it say with non-immunocompromised people.\nLastly, we’ll take a look at the overall distributions for each key value in order to understand the survey in greater detail.\nfig, axs = plt.subplots(5, 2, figsize=(40, 30))\n\ngroups = cdc['group'].unique()\nfor i, ax in zip(range(10), axs.ravel()):\n    if i == 9:\n        sns.histplot(cdc, x=\"value\", ax = ax, kde = True)\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title('All')\n        ax.set_xlabel(\"\")\n    else:\n        analysis = cdc[cdc[\"group\"] == groups[i]]\n        sns.histplot(analysis, x=\"value\", ax = ax, kde = True)\n\n        # chart formatting\n        ax.set_title(groups[i])\n\nplt.show()\nFor all subgroups and the dataset as a whole, we can see that the distributions are all rightly skewed. This indicates that most of the percentages collected all fell closer to zero. Since this dataset is heavily filled with categorical data, we will try to develop a way to pear down the features through naive bayes analysis and feature selection within the next section.\nThe following dataset was measured to UK survey and app data regarding symptoms tracked for patients with Long Covid. In order to undertsand the distribution of the data and track the symptoms over time, we can take a look at the following.\nuk_health = pd.read_csv(\"../../data/01-modified-data/long_covid_uk_health_clean.csv\")\nuk_health.drop('Unnamed: 0', axis = 1, inplace= True)\nuk_health.info()\n\n&lt;class 'pandas.core.frame.DataFrame'&gt;\nRangeIndex: 272 entries, 0 to 271\nData columns (total 6 columns):\n #   Column                             Non-Null Count  Dtype  \n---  ------                             --------------  -----  \n 0   symptom                            272 non-null    object \n 1   domain                             272 non-null    object \n 2   group                              272 non-null    object \n 3   estimate                           264 non-null    float64\n 4   lower_95_percent_confidence_limit  264 non-null    float64\n 5   upper_95_percent_confidence_limit  264 non-null    float64\ndtypes: float64(3), object(3)\nmemory usage: 12.9+ KB\nuk_health.head()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nsymptom\ndomain\ngroup\nestimate\nlower_95_percent_confidence_limit\nupper_95_percent_confidence_limit\n\n\n\n\n0\nAbdominal pain\nAll people\nAll people\n9.56\n8.82\n10.30\n\n\n1\nAbdominal pain\nHealth/disability status\nNo health conditions\n6.96\n6.04\n7.87\n\n\n2\nAbdominal pain\nHealth/disability status\nActivity not limited by health conditions\n6.06\n4.26\n7.85\n\n\n3\nAbdominal pain\nHealth/disability status\nActivity limited a little by health conditions\n11.30\n9.70\n12.91\n\n\n4\nAbdominal pain\nHealth/disability status\nActivity limited a lot by health conditions\n17.20\n14.83\n19.56\nSome important features to look at in the data set are symptom, which are the symptoms people tracked in the survey, domain and group, which act similarly to the group and subgroup from the CDC data, and estimate, which is the corresponding percentage of the those who filled out the survey. If we to extrapolate from the survey data, we could also use the lower and upper confidence boundaries.\nIn order to understand the dataset and the symptoms, lets take a look at the symptoms for all people that filled out the survey.\nimport pandas as pd \nimport numpy as np\nimport wordcloud \nimport string \nimport nltk\n\nnltk.download('punkt')\nnltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')\nnltk.download('wordnet')\nnltk.download('stopwords')\nstopwords = nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english')\n\nnews = pd.read_csv('../../data/00-raw-data/long_covid_news_raw.csv')\ntext = news['title'].tolist()\ntext.append(news['content'].tolist())\ntext = ' '.join([str(elem) for elem in text])\n\n# #FILTER OUT UNWANTED CHARACTERS\nnew_text=\"\"\nfor character in text:\n    if character in string.printable:\n        new_text+=character\ntext=new_text\n\n# #FILTER OUT UNWANTED WORDS\nnew_text=\"\"\nfor word in nltk.tokenize.word_tokenize(text):\n    if word not in nltk.corpus.stopwords.words('english'):\n        if word in [\".\",\",\",\"!\",\"?\",\":\",\";\",\"[ removed ]\"]:\n            #remove the last space\n            new_text=new_text[0:-1]+word+\" \"\n        else: #add a space\n            new_text+=word.lower()+\" \"\ntext=new_text\n\nwith open('../../data/01-modified-data/long_covid_news_clean.txt', 'w') as file:\n    # Write the list as a string with elements separated by spaces and add a newline at the end\n    file.write(''.join(map(str, text)) + '\\n')\n\n[nltk_data] Downloading package punkt to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/shchinthak/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package punkt is already up-to-date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package averaged_perceptron_tagger to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/shchinthak/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package averaged_perceptron_tagger is already up-to-\n[nltk_data]       date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/shchinthak/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to\n[nltk_data]     /Users/shchinthak/nltk_data...\n[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\nfile = open(\"../../data/01-modified-data/long_covid_news_clean.txt\", \"r\")\ncontent = file.read()\nprint(content)\ndef generate_word_cloud(my_text):\n    from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS\n    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n    # exit()\n    # Import package\n    # Define a function to plot word cloud\n    def plot_cloud(wordcloud):\n        # Set figure size\n        plt.figure(figsize=(40, 30))\n        # Display image\n        plt.imshow(wordcloud) \n        # No axis details\n        plt.axis(\"off\");\n\n    # Generate word cloud\n    wordcloud = WordCloud(\n        width = 3000,\n        height = 2000, \n        random_state=1, \n        background_color='salmon', \n        colormap='Pastel1', \n        collocations=False,\n        stopwords = STOPWORDS).generate(my_text)\n    plot_cloud(wordcloud)\n    plt.show()\n\ngenerate_word_cloud(content)\n\n[ removed ] [ removed ] `` long colds '' may exist, researchers find studying long covid [ removed ] [ removed ] [ removed ] threads ban sensitive search terms temporary, instagram head says how to cure 'brain fog ' using these super easy expert tips [ removed ] care home boss shocked speed covid variant american long covid sufferers preyed unregulated stem cell clinics a new possible explanation long covid could lead simple treatment patients long covid research is in its most hopeful phase yet have cold cant seem shake? long covid thingand long cold may long-covid may long-term respiratory illness - study it 's long covid: symptoms linger illnesses, leading 'long colds ' long covid: can plant-based, anti-inflammatory diets help? long colds vs. long covid: the differences, similarities symptoms new research offers clues causes long covid fuelling hope eventual treatments [ removed ] brain fog long covid: low serotonin could play role [ removed ] what causes long covid? the answer might gut [ removed ] [ removed ] [ removed ] [ removed ] canadians travelling mexico lyme disease treatments. that worries health experts researchers find long covid might linked brain damage paxlovid may reduce chance long covid. why dont doctors prescribe?

across America, with Mississippi, Alabama, Hawaii and Tennessee among those with the worst.\n97              Dr. Bonnie Henry says while avian flu does not transmit easily from birds to humans, infections \"can happen and are very concerning'' because of the potential for the virus to mix with human influenza and mutate into something much more contagious.\n98

    "text": "In our exploration of Long Covid, we adopted a comprehensive approach that drew upon diverse sources such as governmental data, public surveys, and media coverage. This multifaceted strategy allowed us to gain a nuanced understanding of Long Covid’s global impact and the diverse ways it is being addressed. Given the current literature covering a wide array of symptoms, varying levels of severity, and the inherent uncertainties surrounding this relatively new phenomenon, deciphering the true nature of Long Covid and identifying those most at risk posed significant challenges.\nReturning to the core of our investigation, we revisit the ten data science questions that framed our analysis. These questions served as guiding pillars, steering our exploration through the complex landscape of Long Covid. By systematically addressing these inquiries, we aimed to unravel the intricate web of factors contributing to Long Covid’s manifestation, its impact on different demographics, and the effectiveness of existing measures in mitigating its consequences. Our analysis sought not only to uncover patterns and trends but also to provide valuable insights that contribute to a more informed and nuanced understanding of Long Covid’s implications on a global scale.\nWe begin our exploration by delving into the manifestations of Long Covid symptoms with respect to sex and age. Our initial approach involves visualizing symptoms extracted from the Harvard Survey results categorized by sex. Our observations suggest a potential gender-specific divergence in the impact of Long Covid: men may be more susceptible to mental health issues, while women seem to exhibit physical symptoms linked to mental health, such as hair loss. This pattern is corroborated by findings in the CRIS UK Survey, where, within comparable age groups, men display slightly higher levels of stress and worry compared to women.\nIn our pursuit of understanding whether symptoms can serve as predictors for a patient’s demographic information, we employ decision trees using data from the Harvard survey. Leveraging dimensionality reduction and clustering techniques, our initial exploration reveals that utilizing symptoms to predict hospitalization may not be the most effective approach. Consequently, we pivot our focus to predicting sex through decision trees, unveiling results aligned with our preliminary exploratory data analysis (EDA). The analysis suggests that, to some extent, most symptoms point toward the patient being female, with the exception of confusion, which tends to be more associated with men. Therefore, based on this self-reported data, it emerges that men might exhibit more mental-health related symptoms in response to Long Covid compared to women.\nFor future investigations, introducing a medical professional’s verification of symptoms for each patient, rather than relying solely on survey data, would enhance the robustness of the study. Moreover, a larger and more comprehensive dataset could contribute to refined classification and deeper insights into the intricate dynamics of Long Covid symptoms across diverse demographics.\nBuilding on this, our analysis underscores a critical revelation: the predominant symptoms associated with Long Covid are not primarily respiratory but rather mental in nature. Worry, stress, anxiety, and depression emerge as pervasive symptoms consistently observed across all survey data. Common symptoms encompassing various demographics include stress and worry, weakness, joint pain, and shortness of breath.\nUnveiling correlations between symptoms, we discern connections between respiratory symptoms like cough and various other symptoms. Additionally, we note commonplace associations such as constipation and appetite loss. This nuanced understanding of symptom correlations contributes to a more comprehensive grasp of the intricate manifestations of Long Covid across diverse individuals and conditions.\nFurthermore, we applied Naive Bayes classification to categorize news reports among the three infectious diseases. Remarkably, we successfully developed a model capable of effectively discerning the topics of news articles. This achievement holds significant promise for future applications, especially if media coverage of Long Covid intensifies. The ability to automatically categorize news articles can provide valuable insights and aid in tracking the trajectory of media attention on Long Covid, offering a dynamic tool for ongoing analysis.\nLastly, our sentiment analysis unveils a positive tone within the President’s memorandum regarding the necessary steps to address Long Covid in the United States. Despite lingering challenges such as grief, mental health impacts from the pandemic, and the persisting symptoms of Long Covid for many individuals, the optimistic stance of the government towards addressing Long Covid is a hopeful sign for the future of our society.\nIn the realm of data science and analysis, we confronted challenging questions surrounding Long Covid. We explored the nuanced roles of sex and age in Long Covid symptoms, scrutinized the influence of various demographics on the manifestation of symptoms, examined the media’s neutral response to Long Covid, and observed the government’s optimistic outlook for the future."

Additionally, an expanded collection of historical news on Long Covid, especially spanning the years 2021 and 2022, could provide intriguing insights into the evolution of sentiment over a more extended period. To gain a deeper understanding of the government’s perspective, analyzing congressional hearings on Long Covid and exploring documentation from other countries would contribute to a more comprehensive and global approach to studying this condition."

    "text": "Preparing the Data\nFirst, we’ll need to prepare both the labeled text data and the labeled record data. This includes properly formatting and cleaning the data as well as breaking the dataset into train, validate, and testing sets.\n\nLong Covid News\nTo understand the nature of long covid reporting, we will also need to take a look at the differences between long covid reporting and the reporting of other illnesses or diseases. Thus, let’s head back to the News dataset containing news articles from the web for the past month with the key works “Long Covid”, “Influeza”, and “Chickenpox”. As we can concluded in our sentiment analysis, the articles written regarding Long Covid are, in fact, more neutral in comparison to the other two infectious diseases. From this conclusion of sentiment analysis, we may infer that the Naive Bayes classifier may also be able to determine the difference between media coverage on each disease. Therefore, we will use these infectious disease labels within our Naive Bayes classifier to try to accurately predict long covid messaging within the media.\n\nFeature SelectionResultsConfusion MatrixAccuracy Plots\n\n\nUsing the text data provided from the News API, we’ll first conduct a feature selection on the data in order to determine the words/phrases that are highly correlated with the classification label.

Additionally, the training and testing accuracy is quite different, with the training data leveling in its accuracy at approximately 87% at around 100 features, while the testing accuracy was close to 100% when ran on 500 features. Runtime is also approximately the same in pattern, however, the testing model does take a longer time than the train. Thus, while the testing accuracy is very good for this model, there could be a few reasons why the difference between train and test is so drastic. Primarily, the data set may be too small to accurately predict these topics, and therefore, the model is overfitting. In the same regard, the train and test split may not have been randomized enough to provide an accurate modeling scenario. Lastly, this could also mean that differences between media coverage on these infectious diseases is quite minimal and therefore cannot be classified by a model.\n\n\nCDC Long Covid Survey\nFirst, let’s prepare the data for Naive Bayes Classification. Please note that since our feature set is very small (n=3), we will use all the features for our classifier. If the feature set was larger, we would use sklearn’s feature selection tool in order to identify the best features to represent the data without being cross-correlated.\n\nModel ResultsConfusion MatrixDistribution PlotDensity PlotsReminder: Key Definitions\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncdc = pd.read_csv(\"../../data/01-modified-data/cdc_clean.csv\")\ncdc_naive = cdc[['group', 'subgroup', 'value', 'key']]\ncdc_naive['group'] = cdc_naive['group'].astype('category').cat.codes\ncdc_naive['subgroup'] = cdc_naive['subgroup'].astype('category').cat.codes\n\n\nX_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(cdc_naive[['group', 'subgroup', 'value']], cdc_naive['key'], test_size = 0.2, random_state = 5000)\n\nclassifier = GaussianNB()\nclassifier.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\ny_predicted = classifier.predict(X_test)\nprint(\"The accuray of the multinomial naive bayes model is: \", accuracy_score(y_test, y_predicted))\n\n# Classfier report\nprint(classification_report(y_test, y_predicted))\n\n\nThe accuray of the multinomial naive bayes model is:  0.6938877755511023\n              precision    recall  f1-score   support\n\n           1       0.58      0.77      0.66       264\n           2       0.63      0.78      0.70       265\n           3       0.59      0.62      0.60       270\n           4       0.61      0.32      0.42       250\n           5       0.90      0.92      0.91       278\n           6       1.00      0.96      0.98       119\n           7       0.59      0.68      0.63       208\n           8       0.29      0.12      0.17       123\n           9       0.95      0.93      0.94       219\n\n    accuracy                           0.69      1996\n   macro avg       0.68      0.68      0.67      1996\nweighted avg       0.68      0.69      0.68      1996\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nconf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_predicted)\n\n# Plot the confusion matrix as a heatmap\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))\nsns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt='g', cmap='Blues', xticklabels=['Class 0', 'Class 1', 'Class 2', 'Class 3', 'Class 4', 'Class 5', 'Class 6', 'Class 7', 'Class 8'],\n            yticklabels=['Class 0', 'Class 1', 'Class 2', 'Class 3', 'Class 4', 'Class 5', 'Class 6', 'Class 7', 'Class 8'])\nplt.xlabel('Predicted')\nplt.ylabel('Actual')\nplt.title('Confusion Matrix')\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(6, 4))\ncdc_naive['key'].value_counts().plot(kind='bar', color='green')\nplt.xlabel('Class')\nplt.ylabel('Count')\nplt.title('Class Distribution')\nplt.xticks(rotation=0)\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nfeature_columns = ['group', 'subgroup', 'value']  \nfig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(12, 6))\n\nfor feature, ax in zip(feature_columns, axs.ravel()):\n    for class_label in cdc_naive['key'].unique():  # Replace 'label_column' with your actual label column name\n        sns.histplot(cdc_naive[cdc_naive['key'] == class_label][feature], kde=True, label=f'Class {class_label}', ax = ax)\n        \n    ax.set_title(f'Distribution of {feature} by Class')\n    ax.set_xlabel(feature)\n    ax.set_ylabel('Density')\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDC Keys\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter training the classifier on our training data and running predictions of the test set, we can see that the Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier had an accuracy score of approximately 70%. Thus, given the demographic grouping, subgrouping, and estimated percentage of the survey group, we are able to predict the person’s experience with Long Covid with approximately 70% accuracy. Let’s take a closer look at the classifier though visualizations.\nHere, we can see that the confusion matrix shows a strong correlation along the diagonal, meaning that the predicted classes correctly correlate to the actual classes. There are a few cases where the classifier incorrectly classified the objects, such as predicting class 0 instead of class 4 or predicting class 6 instead of class 2. Rather than the classifier itself, this may also be an issue with the ‘closeness’ of these classes.\nWe can also look at the class distribution within the dataset, first overall, and then by feature.\nFrom these visualizations, we can see that class 7 and 8 are the least represented within the dataset, primarily because they represent extreme cases of inactivity or immobility due to Long Covid from patients who are currently experiencing Long Covid and those who have previously experienced symptoms. Additionally, and what is more surprising, is that the distributions for each class when viewing through group and subgroup are not nearly as distinct as when viewing classes through the value feature. Thus, we can say that the classifier heavily depended on the value feature to predict the classes."

Primarily, the long covid media coverage collected seems to be “different” to some degree in comparison to coverage of other diseases. This may be due to journalistic style of writing; however, it may also be attributed to the smaller dataset. Additionally, for the CDC data, we were able to get fairly accurate results of classification of people with differing long covid experiences based on their demographics. With additional information on symptoms, this classifier could be incredibly useful to help individuals understand their severity of long covid in comparison to historical records."
