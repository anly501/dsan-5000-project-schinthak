44                          Covid-19 hasn’t gone away, and it won’t any time soon. It’s now part of the landscape of health threats. Although the coronavirus continues to kill and cause lasting damage, our immunity, vaccines and treatments have tamed the pandemic.

92                                                                                                            Just ahead of Thanksgiving and winter holidays, the U.S. is facing a deluge of viral illnesses. Flu and RSV cases are rising. What's happening with Covid?
93                                                                                                          Avian flu is spreading rapidly again through poultry farms in British Columbia, with the virus discovered in half a dozen commercial flocks this week alone.
94                                                                                                             There are more walk-ins with a respiratory illness in southeastern states in the latest recorded week, with the first pediatric flu death in Mississippi.
95                                                                                                                                                  Hospitals in northern China are being overwhelmed amid a spike in respiratory infections, especially among children.
96                                                                                                            There is a vast difference in average historic mortality rates across America, with Mississippi, Alabama, Hawaii and Tennessee among those with the worst.
97              Dr. Bonnie Henry says while&nbsp;avian&nbsp;flu&nbsp;does not transmit easily from birds to humans, infections "can happen and are very concerning'' because of the potential for the&nbsp;virus&nbsp;to mix with human&nbsp;influenza&nbsp;and mutate into something much more contagious.
98                                                                                                                                                                        Consumers can expect modestly lower costs to prepare their Thanksgiving Day meal — here's why.

104                                                                                                           Ontario's top doctor says there is "a lot" of COVID-19 circulating in the province right now, and levels of both that virus and influenza are on the rise.

114                          Physicians are saying a rise in Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza and COVID-19 are overburdening an already fragile health care system. The government is partially blaming the strikes as hospitals function at lower capacity.

123                                            It has been nearly four years since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but that is not stopping Bloomberg from legitimately addressing if it is "safe to dine indoors" as winter approaches and "Covid" comes "back."
