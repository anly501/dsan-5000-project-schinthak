From pandemic-induced restrictions to the eventual easing of regulations, the numbers paint a vivid picture of change. In the wake of lifted restrictions in 2021, a surge in parking violations sweeps across the city, as restaurants and venues reopened their doors. Additionally, we see a much larger range in parking violations given that moving violations due to D.C’s free parking policy on Sundays and National holidays. Thus, for parking violations, we can see a consistent weekly seasonal pattern. In terms of the moving violations, we do not see as much of a consistent weekly pattern as parking violations, however some seasonality is present. Surprisingly, we can see an inverse seasonal pattern to parking violations, most likely due to more driving violations occurring on the weekends as opposed to weekdays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe number of parking violations is consistently higher than moving violations, with seasonal fluctuations every week.

However, they are ineffective if people do not fully pay them. Therefore, it’s crucial to understand the status of fine payments in the D.C. area as well as whether there is a significant difference between moving and parking violations. Initially, we planned to plot each data point in our dataset, but the large volume of data made this impractical. Therefore, we chose to aggregate the data points by Year-Month. This approach not only simplifies plotting but also allows us to investigate if the month influences fine payment behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis image shows the fine amounts and payments for moving/parking violations for each month of every year.

A closer look at the distribution of points reveals key patterns. When comparing moving and parking violations, we observe that while the payment rates for parking violations are relatively concentrated, those for moving violations vary significantly from month to month. This suggests that the factors affecting fines for moving violations, such as the severity of the offense, contribute to greater fluctuations in payment rates. Additionally, we’ve noticed a consistent trend where payment rates for moving violations are particularly low during the months of May, June, and July. This could be due to an increase in summer travel, bringing in more non-local drivers who may not pay their fines promptly.\n\n\nWhere can we view violation information by location?\n\nViolations Payment Details\n\n\n\n\nThis interactive table shows an in depth view of every moving and parking violation in D.C. from 2020 - 2023.
