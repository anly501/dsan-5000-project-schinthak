# Streaming

*Click the image to view the API*

The spotify API allows for access to all kinds of streaming data including artist music records and an analysis on their musical compponents. Using spotify data, I plan to analyze overall trends of popular music throughout the years as well as specific international artists with popular debuts in the U.S. 

For example, here is a plot the artists Taylor Swift, BTS, and Twice and their music's danceability over a period of 10 years. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| warning: false

library(ggplot2)
library(knitr)
library(spotifyr)
library(dplyr)
library(lubridate)
library(plotly)

Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID = "48875e31f589401f83c6bd43005d94f7")
Sys.setenv(SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET = "d215e4ea690d4b9b9c1c5e0afbb113a5")
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
#| warning: false

access_token <- get_spotify_access_token()
artists <- c("BTS", "Taylor Swift", "Twice")

BTS <- get_artist_audio_features("BTS")
BTS_A <- data.frame(BTS$artist_name,
BTS$instrumentalness,
BTS$valence,
BTS$danceability,
BTS$energy,
BTS$loudness,
BTS$speechiness,
BTS$acousticness,
BTS$liveness,
BTS$tempo,
BTS$track_name,
BTS$album_name,
BTS$album_release_year,
BTS$album_release_date)

colnames(BTS_A) <- c("artist_name","instrumentalness","Valence","danceability","energy",
"loudness","speechiness","acousticness","liveness",
"tempo","track_name","album_name","album_release_year","date")

Taylor_Swift <- get_artist_audio_features("Taylor Swift")
Taylor_Swift_A <- data.frame(Taylor_Swift$artist_name,
Taylor_Swift$instrumentalness,
Taylor_Swift$valence,
Taylor_Swift$danceability,
Taylor_Swift$energy,
Taylor_Swift$loudness,
Taylor_Swift$speechiness,
Taylor_Swift$acousticness,
Taylor_Swift$liveness,
Taylor_Swift$tempo,
Taylor_Swift$track_name,
Taylor_Swift$album_name,
Taylor_Swift$album_release_year,
Taylor_Swift$album_release_date)

colnames(Taylor_Swift_A) <- c("artist_name","instrumentalness","Valence","danceability","energy",
"loudness","speechiness","acousticness","liveness",
"tempo","track_name","album_name","album_release_year","date")


Twice <- get_artist_audio_features("Twice")
Twice_A <- data.frame(Twice$artist_name,
Twice$instrumentalness,
Twice$valence,
Twice$danceability,
Twice$energy,
Twice$loudness, 
Twice$speechiness,
Twice$acousticness,
Twice$liveness,
Twice$tempo,
Twice$track_name,
Twice$album_name,
Twice$album_release_year,
Twice$album_release_date)

colnames(Twice_A) <- c("artist_name","instrumentalness","Valence","danceability","energy",
"loudness","speechiness","acousticness","liveness",
"tempo","track_name","album_name","album_release_year","date")

artists <- rbind(BTS_A, Taylor_Swift_A, Twice_A)
artists$date <- as.Date(artists$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

fig <- plot_ly(artists, x = ~date, y = ~danceability, color = ~artist_name, 
               type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', size = ~speechiness) 

fig <- fig %>% layout(xaxis = list(title = "Album Released Date"),
                      yaxis = list(title ="Danceability"), 
                      title = "Danceability - Taylor Swift/BTS/Twice")

fig
```

We can see that the prior to the introduction of international stars BTS and Twice, American artist Taylor Swift had a lower degree of danceability and speechiness. Both increased as BTS and Twice entered the market, noting a slight shift in the music trends. 

# Music Charts

One of the longest music charting services is the Billboard Chart. Every week, starting from 1958, the Billboard charts have documented the 100 top songs in the U.S. Thus, I will be using this data to anaylze the most popular songs throughout 1958-2021. Augmenting this data with genres of the songs and orgins of the artist can help further describe the globalization trends in music charting. 

# Music Stock:

Using the **Quantmod** package, we can analyze the stock prices of several music record companies over a course of multiple years. This will allow us to identify specific trends within the music industry as well as interpret shareholder's opinions of globalization news throughout history. 

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| output: false
#| warnings: false
library(plotly)
library(quantmod)

getSymbols("UMGNF",src='yahoo')
```

```{r}
#| code-fold: true
# basic example of ohlc charts
df <- data.frame(Date=index(UMGNF),coredata(UMGNF))
df <- tail(df, 365)

fig <- df %>% plot_ly(x = ~Date, type="candlestick",
          open = ~UMGNF.Open, close = ~UMGNF.Close,
          high = ~UMGNF.High, low = ~UMGNF.Low) 
fig <- fig %>% layout(title = "Universal Music Group Candlestick Chart")

fig

```

# Quantifying Globalization

[![](kof.png){width=30% fig-align='center'}](https://kof.ethz.ch/en/forecasts-and-indicators/indicators/kof-globalisation-index.html)

[Click here to download the data](KOFGI_2022_public.xlsx)

The KOF Globalization index is a way to quantify globalization of a country. This metric was started in the 1970's as countries increasingly began to embrace globalization. This metric can be used in tandum with music trends in order to decipher if musical globalization is happening concurrently with general globalization.  

# Live Music
[![](touring.png){width=70% fig-align='center'}](https://touringdata.wordpress.com/2019/02/16/bts-love-yourself-tour/)

Using revenue data from the world tours of all 8 artists over their careers (up until the last decade), we will be able to analyze the economic impact of concerts in the United States, both from Western and KPOP artists. 

# Korean Tourism
[![](tourism.png){width=70% fig-align='center'}](https://www.statista.com/statistics/709116/south-korea-inbound-visitors/)

In order to expand upon globalization, we'll also use tourism statistics inbound South Korea as a ways to measure interest in the country over time. I've gathered both yearly data of a count of those who visited South Korea purely for tourism as well as monthly data of international arrivals (as a number of passengers) into [Incheon Airport](https://www.airport.kr/co/en/cpr/statisticCategoryOfTimeSeries.do#none), the largest international airport in the country.
