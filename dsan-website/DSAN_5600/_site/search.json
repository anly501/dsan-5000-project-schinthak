First I will begin by filtering the data and creating a time series object in R. This will allow us to plot the time series data for initial analysis.\n\nTime Series plot:\n\n\nCode\n# Import dataset\nglobal &lt;- read_csv('globalization.csv')\n\n# Filter information\nglobal &lt;- global %&gt;%\n  filter(country == 'United States') %&gt;%\n  select(year, KOFGI) %&gt;%\n  mutate(year = as.Date(year))\n\n# Create time series\nglobal_ts &lt;-ts(global$KOFGI, star=decimal_date(as.Date(\"1970-01-01\", format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")), frequency = 1)\n\n# Create time series plot\nglobal_plot &lt;- plot(as.ts(global_ts), main = \"Time Series of KOF Globalization Index within the United States\",\n                  xlab = 'Time', ylab = 'KOF Index')\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Show plot\nggplotly(global_plot)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the plot of the globalization index in the United States, we can see a strong positive upward trend. In terms of seasonality and cyclic patterns, we are unable to see such patterns in the plot. Additionally, we can see very slight peaks in the data in 1986 and 2009, however, they are not enough to conclude any patterns in the data. Thus,we can say this plot is neither additive nor multiplicative.\nNext, let’s take a look at a few lag plots of data on itself as well ACF and PACF in order to identify possible signs of stationarity.\n\n\nLag-plot:\n\n\nCode\ngglagplot(global_ts, do.lines=FALSE)+ggtitle(\"Lag Plot for the KOF Globalization Index\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see in lags 1,2, and 3 a very strong positive linear relationship, meaning a positive autocorrelation in the lags. From lag 4 and onward, the trend is still strongly positive, but less linear, suggesting a weaker autocorrelation. We also don’t see any groupings in the lags, suggesting that there is no seasonality in the data.\n\n\nACF & PACF:\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(global_ts)+ggtitle(\"ACF Plot for Globalization Index\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(global_ts)+ggtitle(\"PACF Plot for Globalization Index\")\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking at the ACF and PACF plots, we get a better understanding this time series. The ACF plot shows the present lag is significantly correlated with the first 12 years, after which it become significantly uncorrelated. Additionally, the PACF shows a stationary plot, due to the PACF values being contained in the significance bands. Thus, we can say that there is in fact strong autocorrelation in this time series data, however correlation is not present within the residuals.\n\n\nDickey-Fuller Test\n\n\nCode\nglobal_test &lt;- adf.test(global_ts)\nprint(global_test)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  global_ts\nDickey-Fuller = 0.59021, Lag order = 3, p-value = 0.99\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller Test, with tests the alternative hypothesis that the time series is stationary, concluded a p-value of 0.99. Since 0.99 &gt; 0.05, we do not have enough evidence and thus, fail to rejec the null hypothesis, meaning that the time series object is not stationary.\n\n\nStationary:\nTherefore, in order to obtain stationary data to runs an ARMA and AMRIMA model on, we will need to compare differenced and detrended data to find which approach produces stationary data.\n\n\nCode\nfit = lm(global_ts~time(global_ts), na.action=NULL) \n\nplot1 &lt;- ggAcf(global_ts, 50, main=\"Original Data: Globalization Index\")\nplot2 &lt;- ggAcf(resid(fit), 50, main=\"Detrended data\") \nplot3 &lt;- ggAcf(diff(global_ts), 50, main=\"First Differenced Data\")\n\ngrid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3,ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom this plot, we can clearly see that the first differenced data results in a stationary plot, with the ACF values inside the significance bands. Since the first difference was able to coerce the data to be stationary, we can also say that the original data was linearly trended. Thus, moving forward, we will use first differencing on the globalization index in order to model this value."

From 2021 to 2022, we can see a strong positive trend with slight seasonality. However, from 2022 onwards we see a sharp downward trend and with varying degrees of peaks. Thus, the uneven nature of the peaks and troughs results in data that is neither additive or multiplicative. Additionally, since the dataset is smaller, we cannot say anything of certain regarding cyclical patterns.\nNext, let’s take a look at a few lag plots of data on itself as well ACF and PACF in order to identify possible signs of stationarity.\n\n\nLag-plot:\n\n\nCode\ngglagplot(HYBE_ts, do.lines=FALSE)+\n  ggtitle(\"Lag Plot for HYBE Stock Prices\")+\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThese lag plots show similar results to that of the globalization index. The forst four lags have a very strong positive linear correlation, suggesting autocorrelation amongst those lags. From lag 5 onwards, we still see a string linear correlation, however we can also see a small circular pattern forming in the lag plots, suggesting a possibility of single-cycle sinusodial data.\n\n\nACF & PACF:\n\n\nCode\nggAcf(HYBE_ts, lag.max = 30)+ggtitle(\"ACF Plot for HYBE Stock Prices\")\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggPacf(HYBE_ts, lag.max = 30)+ggtitle(\"PACF Plot for HYBE Stock Prices\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilar to the globalization index, the ACF plot shows the present lag is significantly correlated with all other present lags in the plot, since all values are well above the siginificance bands. Additionally, the PACF shows a stationary plot, due to the PACF values being contained in the significance bands. Thus, we can say that there is in fact strong autocorrelation in this time series data, however correlation is not present within the residuals.\n\n\nDickey-Fuller Test:\n\n\nCode\nHYBE_test &lt;- adf.test(HYBE_ts)\nprint(HYBE_test)\n\n\n\n    Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test\n\ndata:  HYBE_ts\nDickey-Fuller = -2.0109, Lag order = 10, p-value = 0.5737\nalternative hypothesis: stationary\n\n\nThe Dickey-Fuller Test resulted in a p-value of 0.5737. Since 0.5737 &gt; 0.05, we can fail to reject the null hypothesis and say that the time series object is not stationary.\n\n\nStationary:\nGiven that the original data is not stationary through the Dickey-Fuller test, we will use the detrending and differencing methods to coerse the data to become stationary.\n\n\nCode\nfit = lm(HYBE_ts~time(HYBE_ts), na.action=NULL) \n\nplot1 &lt;- ggAcf(HYBE_ts, lag.max = 30, main=\"Original Data: HYBE Stock Prices\")\nplot2 &lt;- ggAcf(resid(fit), lag.max = 30, main=\"Detrended data\") \nplot3 &lt;- ggAcf(diff(HYBE_ts), lag.max = 30, main=\"First Differenced Data\")\n\ngrid.arrange(plot1, plot2, plot3, ncol=3)\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, after trying both detrending and first difference methods, both result in ACF plots showing autocorrelation and non-stationary tendencies. Thus, we will try the second differencing approach.\n\n\nCode\nplot4 &lt;- ggAcf(diff(diff(HYBE_ts)), lag.max = 30, main=\"Second Differenced Data\")\nplot4\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the second difference, we were able to get the HYBE stock prices to become stationary. Therefore, we could also suggest the original data has quadratic trending behavior.\nThus, going forward, we can use the second difference of the HYBE stock prices for modeling."

    "text": "What is a Time Series ?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Looking a combination of high end and low end brands, we can see that all companies faced a massive downtick in price evaluations in March of 2020, signaling the announcement of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Something to point out is that Christian Dior had a spike in price around mid-2021, resulting in a high uptick compared to the other brands. I was unable to find a reason as to why this uptick occured, but we can assume it was due to the highend nature of the brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2:\nThe following graph depicts the precipication in Washington D.C. from January 2021 - January 2022.

However, the market was able to recover such that the women who did work were able to in the 2010’s. The next major event was the COVID-19 global pandemic. Due to a global shutdown, there was a major spike in unemployement. This may be due to several women also being mothers and needing to stay home for childcare as a result of childcare services being unavailable at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Music as a representation of culture has been defined since the birth of human connection and communities for centuries. In the past few decades, we have seen a transformation in music listening and sharing, from physical records to digital purchases to modern day streaming. Specifically in the United States (U.S.), popular music has, for the most part, been contained to English speaking, American artists. However, we can note artists like Bob Marley in the 1970’s for example, introducing a minority genre like reggae into the popular mainstream in the United States, but also the rest of the word Music and Globalization: Critical Encounters (2012). Or in recent years, the rise of Kpop, through groups like BTS, becoming increasingly popular in Western markets, to the point where it is considered part of the Pop genre Wang. With this new found accessibility of all kinds of music through streaming, there comes the question of how music listening and cultural exchange has changed in the U.S.\nWe can define such a question as the globalization of music sharing, or more specifically, the globalization of music in the United States. At the moment, there is literature to discuss both viewpoints of music globalization; the first being that streaming has expanded the average U.S. consumer’s music palette from traditional American music, while the second suggests that streaming has only narrowed the average listener’s taste through algorithmic suggestions and playlists Bello and Garcia (2021). Cultural Divergence in popular music suggests that while clustering in music tastes can be noted for specific regions of the world, we do see an “upward trend in music consumption diversity that started in 2017 and spans across platforms” Bello and Garcia (2021).\nHowever, in order to fully realize the question of globalization of music listening in the U.S. through time, I propose analyzing the following: music streaming statistics, music charting on Billboard and iTunes, stock prices for music record companies, and sentiment analysis of popular music across social media platforms.\n\nThese four analytical venues will provide an in-depth analysis to further understand whether the trend of globalization of cultures has in fact translated to music listening and whether the average American has positive sentiment to this overall trend.\n\n\n\nHow has streaming in comparison to other music sharing methods affected the listening tastes of the average American over time?\nHow does music charting influence music created today across the globe?\nTo what extent has the globalization of music listening in the United States led to a positive or negative sentiment among the general population?\nHas the globalization of music changed the overall trends of popular music in America (i.e musical elements, danceability, etc.)?\nWhat combined conclusions can be drawn from the four analytical venues demonstrated in the big-ideas chart?\nCan time-series analysis of sentiment data on social media platforms uncover shifts in public perception of international music?\nWhat are some long term trends in music stock prices?\nHow has the availability of international music changed over time and how does that translate to globalization?\nAre there any cyclical trends present in popular genres within the United States in the past 20 years?\nIs the globalization of music in the U.S. simply a fad of our time or a product of technical advancements in music dispersion?"

We will be looking at the general globalization index values as well as technology, culture, and TV and Media, since it all correlates to sphere of music and music streaming in the modern world.\nThrough R, I cleaning the dataset from KOF and used Tableau to create interative global maps for each respective index system.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\nglobal &lt;- read_excel(\"KOFGI_2022_public.xlsx\")\nglobal &lt;- global %&gt;%\n  select(code, country, year, KOFGI, KOFInGIdf, KOFInGIdj, KOFCuGIdf) %&gt;%\n  drop_na(c(KOFGI, KOFInGIdf, KOFInGIdj, KOFCuGIdf))\n\nwrite.csv(global, \"globalization.csv\", row.names=FALSE)\n\n\nFrom this cleaned data, we can visualize the globalization index over time for general globalization as well as indexes specifc to culture and entertainment.\nPlease allow for the visualization to load when moving the slider as it handles a large amount of data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n\n\nFrom the graphs, we can a gradual increase in the globalization index over the past 50 years. Specifically, North America, Western Europe, and Australia have the highest globalization indexes across all index types throughout the 50 years. Additionally, we can see that in 1990, Russia’s globalization index was added, resulting in the world’s largest populous countries to be added to the index. Once we get to 2000, we continue to see the highest globalization values in North America, Western Europe (specifically UK and France), and Australia, with new additions like South Korea and Japan with higher values. By 2020, the aforementioned countries have even higher index values, most in the 80’s and 90’s out of 100. China, Russia, Brazil, and India are also most notable countries with very high globalization values, especially in the technology category."

Starting with the oldest public record label, SONY seems to have a seasonal downward trend from 2000 - 2001, however that quickly ends to a more irregular and constant movement. We can see a large spike again in the early 2022, possibly due to SONY’s press release for the vison-s suv, a self driving car Lawler (2022). Of the other stocks, a notable one to note is the introduction of HYBE Co. in late 2020. HYBE, a South Korean Entertainment company, founded by Bang Shi Hyuk, is notable for its creation of the current largest boy band in the industy, BTS. With their international Billboard Hot 100 #1 song, Dynamite, releasing in August of 2020, the band a stirred enough interest for the company’s entrance in the market to be a success at $188 USD. The price reached a high in November of 2021 at $306 USD, most likely due to BTS’s Artist of the Year award at the 2021 American Music Awards and their Grammy nomination. However, since that peak, the price has gone down significantly in June of 2022, likely a result of the company’s largest artists, BTS, announcing a hiatus of group activities due to military enlistment “HYBE Shares Rise as World Contemplates Company Sans BTS” (2022). Amonst the remaining tickers, we can a gradual positive trend with no seasonality and a slight spike around early 2022, as artists were announcing in person activities after the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, we can see through these stock prices that while American record companies seem to a large and consistent history in the market, new companies like HYBE and SM from South Korea have started to take space in the public markets."

In order to see the trends in musical globalization, I will be taking a look artists who acheived number 1’s on the Billboard Hot 100 and the number of weeks those songs stayed on the chart from 2010 - 2021.

The song stayed on the charts for 78 weeks, being song with the most weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in this timeframe. The next non-Western artist would be BTS, as mentioned previously, with their song Dynamite, first debuting number one in September of 2020. BTS appears again in June 2021, with their song Butter which stayed on the charts for 15 weeks. Latin Artists Bad Bunny and J Balvin also made a debut on the charts at number 1 with the song I Like It along side Cardi B for a total of 12 weeks on the charts. Thus, we can see that after 2015, we saw an increaing number of number 1’s from non-Western artists on the America charts, a sign of general positive feedback from the public regarding the globalization of music."
