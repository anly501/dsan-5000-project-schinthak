This is due to a number of factors, the main reason being that KPOP on recently entered in the Western music industry and radio play is little to none for KPOP songs in the United States. Radio play is important to note as that is one of the metrics Billboard uses for charting."

Additionally, KPOP artists also tended to have larger speechiness than Western artists, with the exception of Beyoncé and Drake. This is due to the fact that almost all KPOP groups have designated rappers for every song in comparison to Western pop singers that don’t.\nGoing forward, we’ll also predict each artists popularity for the coming years and the musical characteristics that best forecast popularity. Based on the current EDA, popularity seems to be heavily based on speechiness, and thus, KPOP, along side Drake’s discography, seems to have a higher popularity than other Western Artists."

However, pinpointing whether this was due to Korean cultural exchange was the second step, which is why I moved to using an AR + ARCH model with Korean tourism as an additional metric.\nWhen taking into account Korean international passengers on cultural globalization within the US, we saw that globalization trended downwards in the coming years. This could mean that when using international travel into South Korea as a predictor, cultural globalization decreases in the United States. Thus, this could mean that in the future, we may be seeing a slight decrease in Korean media being embraced within the United States."

Contrarily, the other Korean lables seem to have postively trended forecast when predicted with HYBE. Thus, rather than KPOP in general dominating the music industry, we can say that artists from HYBE, specifically their most popular artist, BTS, has had the biggest impact on the stock market.\n\n\nSimilarly, it can be noted that through the analysis of the VAR models created as well as the ARCH model, HYBE seems to be significantly related to Korean record labels in comparison to the Western records labels.\nLastly, we can see from the ARCH model that accounting for all the volatility in the data results in a constant prediction, for the next 50 days. This could mean a number of things, but one that we can speak about is that the predictors (SM, JYP, and YG) are not the best indicators of predicting HYBE stock prices. Thus, ARCH may not be the best model for predicting HYBE stock."

What combined conclusions can be drawn from the four analytical venues demonstrated in the big-ideas chart?\n\nThus, we can say that KPOP has had a significant effect on the music industry as of recent. We have see that KPOP artists like BTS has recently entered the Billboard Hot 100, taking the first steps for the genre. Additionally, we saw that musically, popular music in the US is gravitating towards an R&B and Hip Hop sound, which, many KPOP groups have garnered a sound that blends both genres with intense dancability. In terms of a cultural shift, we can only see a slight increase in korean globalization within the Western world, however, record labels like HYBE have carved their own path as one of the leading record labels in the entire industry. It’s appart that KPOP groups have always been inspired by Western artists, but it is also clear that many groups are now defining a genre that will be a stand out in the Western music industry."

    "text": "What is a Time Series ?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

Additionally, we can see that in 1990, Russia’s globalization index was added, resulting in the world’s largest populous countries to be added to the index. Once we get to 2000, we continue to see the highest globalization values in North America, Western Europe (specifically UK and France), and Australia, with new additions like South Korea and Japan with higher values. By 2020, the aforementioned countries have even higher index values, most in the 80’s and 90’s out of 100. China, Russia, Brazil, and India are also most notable countries with very high globalization values, especially in the technology category."

Starting with the oldest public record label, SONY seems to have a seasonal downward trend from 2000 - 2001, however that quickly ends to a more irregular and constant movement. We can see a large spike again in the early 2022, possibly due to SONY’s press release for the vison-s suv, a self driving car Lawler (2022). Of the other stocks, a notable one to note is the introduction of HYBE Co. in late 2020. HYBE, a South Korean Entertainment company, founded by Bang Shi Hyuk, is notable for its creation of the current largest boy band in the industy, BTS. With their international Billboard Hot 100 #1 song, Dynamite, releasing in August of 2020, the band a stirred enough interest for the company’s entrance in the market to be a success at $188 USD. The price reached a high in November of 2021 at $306 USD, most likely due to BTS’s Artist of the Year award at the 2021 American Music Awards and their Grammy nomination. However, since that peak, the price has gone down significantly in June of 2022, likely a result of the company’s largest artists, BTS, announcing a hiatus of group activities due to military enlistment “HYBE Shares Rise as World Contemplates Company Sans BTS” (2022). Amonst the remaining tickers, we can a gradual positive trend with no seasonality and a slight spike around early 2022, as artists were announcing in person activities after the Covid-19 pandemic. Thus, we can see through these stock prices that while American record companies seem to a large and consistent history in the market, new companies like HYBE and SM from South Korea have started to take space in the public markets."

In order to see the trends in musical globalization, I will be taking a look artists who acheived number 1’s on the Billboard Hot 100 and the number of weeks those songs stayed on the chart from 2010 - 2021.

The song stayed on the charts for 78 weeks, being song with the most weeks on the Billboard Hot 100 in this timeframe. The next non-Western artist would be BTS, as mentioned previously, with their song Dynamite, first debuting number one in September of 2020. BTS appears again in June 2021, with their song Butter which stayed on the charts for 15 weeks. Latin Artists Bad Bunny and J Balvin also made a debut on the charts at number 1 with the song I Like It along side Cardi B for a total of 12 weeks on the charts. Thus, we can see that after 2015, we saw an increaing number of number 1’s from non-Western artists on the America charts, a sign of general positive feedback from the public regarding the globalization of music.\n\n\nCode\nselected_artists &lt;- c(\"bts\", \"exo\", \"twice\", \"blackpink\", 'drake', \"beyoncé\", \"beyonce\", \"taylor swift\", \"harry styles\")\n\n# Create a regex pattern to match any of the selected artists\npattern &lt;- paste0(\"\\\\b\", paste(selected_artists, collapse = \"\\\\b|\\\\b\"), \"\\\\b\")\n\n# Subset the dataframe based on selected artists\ncharts &lt;- charts %&gt;%\nmutate(artist = tolower(artist)) %&gt;%\nfilter(str_detect(artist, pattern)) %&gt;%\nmutate(artist = str_extract(artist, paste(selected_artists, collapse = \"|\")))\n\nwrite.csv(charts, \"subset_artist_charts.csv\", row.names=FALSE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n   \n\n\n            &lt;script type='text/javascript'&gt;                    var divElement = document.getElementById('viz1701574496100');                    var vizElement = divElement.getElementsByTagName('object')[0];                    vizElement.style.width='100%';vizElement.style.height=(divElement.offsetWidth*0.75)+'px';                    var scriptElement = document.createElement('script');                    scriptElement.src = 'https://public.tableau.com/javascripts/api/viz_v1.js';                    vizElement.parentNode.insertBefore(scriptElement, vizElement);                &lt;/script&gt;\nHere, we can clearly see that, in terms of the billboard charts, Taylor Swift and Drake dominate in terms of the quantity of songs on the chart per year. Additionally, the only KPOP artist of the four I’ve selected that has made it onto the Billboard Hot 100, as of 2021, was BTS. Other artists like Twice and Blackpink both had 2 etries on the charts in 2022 and 2023 combined."

This can indicate that, especially as musical globalization begins to shape the American music industry, we can see an influx in high energy songs, similar to successful non-Western acts like BTS and Daddy Yankee, across genres as shown with the juxtaposition of Taylor Swift, who has a larger spread of energy throughout her discography."
