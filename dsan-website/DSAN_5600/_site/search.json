    "text": "What is a Time Series ?\n\nAny metric that is measured over regular time intervals makes a Time Series. A time series is a sequence of data points or observations collected or recorded over a period of time at specific, equally spaced intervals. Each data point in a time series is associated with a particular timestamp or time period, making it possible to analyze and study how a particular variable or phenomenon changes over time. Time series data can be found in various domains and can represent a wide range of phenomena, including financial data, economic indicators, weather measurements, stock prices, sales figures, and more.\n\nExample: Weather data, Stock prices, Industry forecasts, etc are some of the common ones.\n\nThe analysis of experimental data that have been observed at different points in time leads to new and unique problems in statistical modeling and inference.\nThe obvious correlation introduced by the sampling of adjacent points in time can severely restrict the applicability of the many conventional statistical methods traditionally dependent on the assumption that these adjacent observations are independent and identically distributed.\n\nKey characteristics of time series data include:\nTemporal Order: Time series data is ordered chronologically, with each data point representing an observation at a specific point in time. The order of data points is critical for understanding trends and patterns over time.\nEqually Spaced Intervals: In most cases, time series data is collected at regular intervals, such as hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly. However, irregularly spaced time series data can also exist.\nDependency: Time series data often exhibits temporal dependency, meaning that the value at a given time is influenced by or related to the values at previous times. This dependency can take various forms, including trends, seasonality. This serial correlation is called as autocorrelation.\nComponents: Time series data can typically be decomposed into various components, including:\nTrend: The long-term movement or direction in the data. Seasonality: Repeating patterns or cycles that occur at fixed intervals. Noise/Irregularity: Random fluctuations or variability in the data that cannot be attributed to the trend or seasonality.\nApplications: Time series data is widely used for various applications, including forecasting future values, identifying patterns and anomalies, understanding underlying trends, and making informed decisions based on historical data.\nAnalyzing time series data involves techniques like time series decomposition, smoothing, statistical modeling, and forecasting. This class will cover but not be limited to traditional time series modeling including ARIMA, SARIMA, the multivariate Time Series modeling including; ARIMAX, SARIMAX, and VAR models, Financial Time Series modeling including; ARCH, GARCH models, and E-GARCH, M-GARCH..ect, Bayesian structural time series (BSTS) models, Spectral Analysis and Deep Learning Techniques for Time Series. Researchers and analysts use software tools like Python, R, and specialized time series libraries to work with and analyze time series data effectively.\nTime series analysis is essential in fields such as finance, economics, epidemiology, environmental science, engineering, and many others, as it provides insights into how variables change over time and allows for the development of predictive models to forecast future trends and outcomes.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Streaming\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the image to view the API\nThe spotify API allows for access to all kinds of streaming data including artist music records and an analysis on their musical compponents. Using spotify data, I plan to analyze overall trends of popular music throughout the years as well as specific international artists with popular debuts in the U.S.\nFor example, here is a plot the artists Taylor Swift, BTS, and Becky G and their music’s danceability over a period of 10 years.\n\n\nCode\naccess_token &lt;- get_spotify_access_token()\nartists &lt;- c(\"BTS\", \"Taylor Swift\", \"Becky G\")\n\nBTS &lt;- get_artist_audio_features(\"BTS\")\nBTS_A &lt;- data.frame(BTS$artist_name,\nBTS$instrumentalness,\nBTS$valence,\nBTS$danceability,\nBTS$energy,\nBTS$loudness,\nBTS$speechiness,\nBTS$acousticness,\nBTS$liveness,\nBTS$tempo,\nBTS$track_name,\nBTS$album_name,\nBTS$album_release_year,\nBTS$album_release_date)\n\ncolnames(BTS_A) &lt;- c(\"artist_name\",\"instrumentalness\",\"Valence\",\"danceability\",\"energy\",\n\"loudness\",\"speechiness\",\"acousticness\",\"liveness\",\n\"tempo\",\"track_name\",\"album_name\",\"album_release_year\",\"date\")\n\nTaylor_Swift &lt;- get_artist_audio_features(\"Taylor Swift\")\nTaylor_Swift_A &lt;- data.frame(Taylor_Swift$artist_name,\nTaylor_Swift$instrumentalness,\nTaylor_Swift$valence,\nTaylor_Swift$danceability,\nTaylor_Swift$energy,\nTaylor_Swift$loudness,\nTaylor_Swift$speechiness,\nTaylor_Swift$acousticness,\nTaylor_Swift$liveness,\nTaylor_Swift$tempo,\nTaylor_Swift$track_name,\nTaylor_Swift$album_name,\nTaylor_Swift$album_release_year,\nTaylor_Swift$album_release_date)\n\ncolnames(Taylor_Swift_A) &lt;- c(\"artist_name\",\"instrumentalness\",\"Valence\",\"danceability\",\"energy\",\n\"loudness\",\"speechiness\",\"acousticness\",\"liveness\",\n\"tempo\",\"track_name\",\"album_name\",\"album_release_year\",\"date\")\n\n\nBecky_G &lt;- get_artist_audio_features(\"Becky G\")\nBecky_G_A &lt;- data.frame(Becky_G$artist_name,\nBecky_G$instrumentalness,\nBecky_G$valence,\nBecky_G$danceability,\nBecky_G$energy,\nBecky_G$loudness, \nBecky_G$speechiness,\nBecky_G$acousticness,\nBecky_G$liveness,\nBecky_G$tempo,\nBecky_G$track_name,\nBecky_G$album_name,\nBecky_G$album_release_year,\nBecky_G$album_release_date)\n\ncolnames(Becky_G_A) &lt;- c(\"artist_name\",\"instrumentalness\",\"Valence\",\"danceability\",\"energy\",\n\"loudness\",\"speechiness\",\"acousticness\",\"liveness\",\n\"tempo\",\"track_name\",\"album_name\",\"album_release_year\",\"date\")\n\nartists &lt;- rbind(BTS_A, Taylor_Swift_A, Becky_G_A)\nartists$date &lt;- as.Date(artists$date, format = \"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\nfig &lt;- plot_ly(artists, x = ~date, y = ~danceability, color = ~artist_name, \n               type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers', size = ~speechiness) \n\nfig &lt;- fig %&gt;% layout(xaxis = list(title = \"Album Released Date\"),\n                      yaxis = list(title =\"Danceability\"), \n                      title = \"Danceability - Taylor Swift/BTS/Becky G\")\n\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can see that the prior to the introduction of international stars BTS and Becky G (Kpop and Latin music), American artist Taylor Swift had a lower degree of danceability and speechiness. Both increased as BTS and Becky entered the market, noting a slight shift in the music trends.\n\n\nMusic Charts\n\n\n\n\n\nClick the image to download the dataset\nOne of the longest music charting services is the Billboard Chart. Every week, starting from 1958, the Billboard charts have documented the 100 top songs in the U.S. Thus, I will be using this data to anaylze the most popular songs throughout 1958-2021. Augmenting this data with genres of the songs and orgins of the artist can help further describe the globalization trends in music charting.\n\n\nMusic Stock:\nUsing the Quantmod package, we can analyze the stock prices of several music record companies over a course of multiple years. This will allow us to identify specific trends within the music industry as well as interpret shareholder’s opinions of globalization news throughout history.\n\n\nCode\n# basic example of ohlc charts\ndf &lt;- data.frame(Date=index(UMGNF),coredata(UMGNF))\ndf &lt;- tail(df, 365)\n\nfig &lt;- df %&gt;% plot_ly(x = ~Date, type=\"candlestick\",\n          open = ~UMGNF.Open, close = ~UMGNF.Close,\n          high = ~UMGNF.High, low = ~UMGNF.Low) \nfig &lt;- fig %&gt;% layout(title = \"Universal Music Group Candlestick Chart\")\n\nfig\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuantifying Globalization\n\n\n\n\n\nClick here to download the data\nThe KOF Globalization index is a way to quantify globalization of a country. This metric was started in the 1970’s as countries increasingly began to embrace globalization. This metric can be used in tandum with music trends in order to decipher if musical globalization is happening at the same time as general globalization.\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"

    "text": "Music as a representation of culture has been defined since the birth of human connection and communities for centuries. In the past few decades, we have seen a transformation in music listening and sharing, from physical records to digital purchases to modern day streaming. Specifically in the United States (U.S.), popular music has, for the most part, been contained to English speaking, American artists. However, we can note artists like Bob Marley in the 1970’s for example, introducing a minority genre like reggae into the popular mainstream in the United States, but also the rest of the word Music and Globalization: Critical Encounters (2012). Or in recent years, the rise of Kpop, through groups like BTS, becoming increasingly popular in Western markets, to the point where it is considered part of the Pop genre Wang. With this new found accessibility of all kinds of music through streaming, there comes the question of how music listening and cultural exchange has changed in the U.S.\nWe can define such a question as the globalization of music sharing, or more specifically, the globalization of music in the United States. At the moment, there is literature to discuss both viewpoints of music globalization; the first being that streaming has expanded the average U.S. consumer’s music palette from traditional American music, while the second suggests that streaming has only narrowed the average listener’s taste through algorithmic suggestions and playlists Bello and Garcia (2021). Cultural Divergence in popular music suggests that while clustering in music tastes can be noted for specific regions of the world, we do see an “upward trend in music consumption diversity that started in 2017 and spans across platforms” Bello and Garcia (2021).\nHowever, in order to fully realize the question of globalization of music listening in the U.S. through time, I propose analyzing the following: music streaming statistics, music charting on Billboard and iTunes, stock prices for music record companies, and sentiment analysis of popular music across social media platforms.\n\nThese four analytical venues will provide an in-depth analysis to further understand whether the trend of globalization of cultures has in fact translated to music listening and whether the average American has positive sentiment to this overall trend.\n\n\n\nHow has streaming in comparison to other music sharing methods affected the listening tastes of the average American over time?\nHow does music charting influence music created today across the globe?\nTo what extent has the globalization of music listening in the United States led to a positive or negative sentiment among the general population?\nHas the globalization of music changed the overall trends of popular music in America (i.e musical elements, danceability, etc.)?\nWhat combined conclusions can be drawn from the four analytical venues demonstrated in the big-ideas chart?\nCan time-series analysis of sentiment data on social media platforms uncover shifts in public perception of international music?\nWhat are some long term trends in music stock prices?\nHow has the availability of international music changed over time and how does that translate to globalization?\nAre there any cyclical trends present in popular genres within the United States in the past 20 years?\nIs the globalization of music in the U.S. simply a fad of our time or a product of technical advancements in music dispersion?"

    "text": "Problem 1:\nThis plot depicts the stock prices for large fashion companies pre and post the COVID-19 pandemic. The fashion brands included are Adidas, Christian Dior, H&M, Nike, Puma, and Ross. Looking a combination of high end and low end brands, we can see that all companies faced a massive downtick in price evaluations in March of 2020, signaling the announcement of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Something to point out is that Christian Dior had a spike in price around mid-2021, resulting in a high uptick compared to the other brands. I was unable to find a reason as to why this uptick occured, but we can assume it was due to the highend nature of the brand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 2:\nThe following graph depicts the precipication in Washington D.C. from January 2021 - January 2022. The graph shows periodic spikes throughout the year, however, the most precipitation occured in the third quarter of the year, with the highest amount occuring on August 20, 2021 at 3.76. The driest part of the year was the last quarter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProblem 3:\nBelow, is a graph depicting the unemployement rate for women in the United States of America throughout the 2000’s. This data was sourced from FRED. From this graph we can see 2 major historical moments that caused women’s unemployement. The 2008 market crash caused the first steep incline in unemployment. However, the market was able to recover such that the women who did work were able to in the 2010’s. The next major event was the COVID-19 global pandemic. Due to a global shutdown, there was a major spike in unemployement. This may be due to several women also being mothers and needing to stay home for childcare as a result of childcare services being unavailable at the time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Back to top"
