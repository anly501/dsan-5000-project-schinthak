During my time at Rutgers University, I was a member and president my senior year of the Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers. Additionally, I was a member of the Voorhees Choir^[The Voorhees Choir is an all women's choir at Rutgers University dating back to 1927.] and a research assistant under Dr. Tawfiq Ammari's Computational Social Science lab working on NLP research surrounding online conversations on Covid-19 and Long Covid. In my free time, I enjoy live music, art museums, and trying new foods.
