The fashion brands included are Adidas, Christian Dior, H&M, Nike, Puma, and Ross. Looking a combination of high end and low end brands, we can see that all companies faced a massive downtick in price evaluations in March of 2020, signaling the announcement of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Something to point out is that Christian Dior had a spike in price around mid-2021, resulting in a high uptick compared to the other brands. I was unable to find a reason as to why this uptick occured, but we can assume it was due to the highend nature of the brand. \n\n```{r}\n# place your ggplotly visualization here\nggplot(stock, aes(x=Dates)) +\n  geom_line(aes(y=NKE, colour=\"NKE\"))+\n  geom_line(aes(y=CHDRY, colour=\"CHDRY\"))+\n  geom_line(aes(y=ROST, colour=\"ROST\"))+\n  geom_line(aes(y=ADDYY, colour=\"ADDYY\"))+\n  geom_line(aes(y=PUMSY, colour=\"PUMSY\"))+\n  geom_line(aes(y=HNNMY, colour=\"HNNMY\"))+\n   labs(\n    title = \"Stock Prices for Large Fashion Companies pre/post Pandemic\",\n    subtitle = \"From 2020-2023\",\n    x = \"Date\",\n    y = \"Adjusted Closing Prices\")+\n    theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill = \"white\", colour = \"grey50\"))+\n    guides(colour=guide_legend(title=\"Fashion Companies\")) \n```\n\n# Problem 2: \nThe following graph depicts the precipication in Washington D.C. from January 2021 - January 2022.

The 2008 market crash caused the first steep incline in unemployment. However, the market was able to recover such that the women who did work were able to in the 2010's. The next major event was the COVID-19 global pandemic. Due to a global shutdown, there was a major spike in unemployement. This may be due to several women also being mothers and needing to stay home for childcare as a result of childcare services being unavailable at the time. \n\n```{r}\n#| warning: false\nunemployement <- read.csv(\"unemployement.csv\")\nunemployement$DATE <- as.Date(unemployement$DATE,\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n\nfig <- plot_ly(unemployement, type = 'scatter', mode = 'lines')%>%\n  add_trace(x = ~DATE, y = ~LNS14000002, line = list(color = 'rgb(255, 0, 0)'))%>%\n  layout(showlegend = F, title='Unemployement Rate for Women in U.S.A during the 2000\\'s',\n         xaxis = list(rangeslider = list(visible = T)))\n\nfig <- fig %>%\n  layout(\n         xaxis = list(zerolinecolor = '#ffff',\n                      zerolinewidth = 2,\n                      gridcolor = 'ffff', \n                      title = 'Time'),\n         yaxis = list(zerolinecolor = '#ffff',\n                      zerolinewidth = 2,\n                      gridcolor = 'ffff', \n                      title = 'Unemployement Rate'),\n         plot_bgcolor='#e5ecf6', width = 900)\n\nfig\n\n```","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n# Problem 1:\n```{r}\n#| output: false\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(quantmod)\nlibrary(tidyquant)\nlibrary(plotly)\n```\n\n```{r}\n#| output: false\noptions(\"getSymbols.warning4.0\"=FALSE)\noptions(\"getSymbols.yahoo.warning\"=FALSE)\n\ntickers = c(\"NKE\",\"CHDRY\",\"ROST\", \"ADDYY\", \"PUMSY\",\"HNNMY\")\nfor (i in tickers){\n  getSymbols(i, from = \"2020-01-01\", to = \"2023-05-01\")}\n\nx <- list(\n  title = \"date\"\n)\n\ny <- list(\n  title = \"value\"\n)\n\nstock <- data.frame(NKE$NKE.Adjusted,\n                    CHDRY$CHDRY.Adjusted,\n                    ROST$ROST.Adjusted,\n                    ADDYY$ADDYY.Adjusted,\n                    PUMSY$PUMSY.Adjusted,\n                    HNNMY$HNNMY.Adjusted)\n\n\nstock <- data.frame(stock,rownames(stock))\ncolnames(stock) <- append(tickers,'Dates')\nhead(stock)\n\nstock$Dates<-as.Date(stock$Dates,\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n```\n\nThis plot depicts the stock prices for large fashion companies pre and post the COVID-19 pandemic.
