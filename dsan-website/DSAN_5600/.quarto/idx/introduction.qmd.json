In the past few decades, we have seen a transformation in music listening and sharing, from physical records, to digital purchases, to modern day streaming. Specifically in the United States (U.S.), popular music has, for the most part, been contained to English speaking American artists. In recent years, however, the rise of KPOP, through groups like BTS, EXO, BlackPink, and TWICE has become increasingly popular in Western markets, to the point where it is considered part of the Pop genre @rollingstoneKPopConquered. With this new found accessibility of KPOP music through streaming, there comes the question of how music listening and cultural exchange has changed in the U.S.\n\nWe can define such a question as the effect of KPOP on the Western Music Industry and its impacts on globalization as a whole. At the moment, there is literature to discuss both viewpoints of music globalization; the first being that streaming has expanded the average U.S. consumer’s music palette from traditional American music, while the second suggests that streaming has only narrowed the average listener’s taste through algorithmic suggestions and playlists @Bello2021. Cultural Divergence in popular music suggests that while clustering in music tastes can be noted for specific regions of the world, we do see an “upward trend in music consumption diversity that started in 2017 and spans across platforms” @Bello2021. \n\nThus, in order to fully realize the question of KPOP's effect on the western music industry through time, I propose analyzing the following: music charting on the Billboard 100, stock prices for music record companies, musical characterists and popularity, and quantifying globalization over time. \n\n\n![](images/MUSIC.png){width=800, fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nTo further break down this analysis, I will briefly discuss the artists I will be focusing on and their imapct the music industry thus far. \n\n## Western Artists\n<img src=\"images/western_artists.png\" alt=\"Western Artists\" width=\"50%\" style=\"display: block; margin: auto;\">\n\n\n### Drake\nDrake is a Canadian rapper, singer, and songwriter who rose to fame in the mid-2000s.

The group originally consisted of 12 members but later downsized to nine: Xiumin, Suho, Lay, Baekhyun, Chen, Chanyeol, D.O., Kai, and Sehun.

Thus, from a social persepective, we must ask whether popular music will start to shift to reflect the average listener of the future. By examining KPOP's effect on the Western music industry, an industry traditionally confined to the U.S and the English langauge, we can begin to analyze whether globalization has also effected music and how it has changed over time. Therefore, to structure our in-depth analysis of this topic through the four branches discussed [above](http://shriya-chinthak.georgetown.domains/DSAN_5600/introduction.html#big-picture), we will be answering the following questions. \n\n\n# Thought-Provoking Questions\n\n1. How do Western Artists compare to KPOP on the Billboard Hot 100 over time? \n\n2. What can be said about the musical characteristics between Western and KPOP artists?\n\n3. What is the relationship between cultural globalization in the U.S. and South Korean international tourism? \n\n4. Is KPOP as a whole propelling into the West or is it a a specific artist/group? \n\n5. Does HYBE seem to fall under the Western music industry, the KPOP industry, or are they in a new league? \n\n6. Accounting for volatility, will HYBE continue its current success, specifically in comparison to the traditionally Western labels? \n\n7. Can we predict popularity of KPOP verses Western music in the coming years? \n\n8. Has cultural globalization been impacted since the onset of KPOP in West? \n\n9. How do musical characterists effect forecasted popularity between Western and KPOP artists? \n\n10. What combined conclusions can be drawn from the four analytical venues demonstrated in the big-ideas chart?  \n\n---\n\n*Next, we will dive into the* [data sources](http://shriya-chinthak.georgetown.domains/DSAN_5600/data-sources.html) *used to complete our analysis*","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nMusic as a representation of culture has been defined since the birth of human connection and communities for centuries.
